<p>As discussed in Chapter 1, one common pattern of communication used by
application programs is the request/reply paradigm, also called <em>message
transaction</em>: A client sends a request message to a server, and the
server responds with a reply message, with the client blocking
(suspending execution) to wait for the reply. <a href="#rpc-timeline">Figure 1</a>
illustrates the basic interaction between the client and server in such
a message transaction.</p>

<p>A transport protocol that supports the request/reply paradigm is much
more than a UDP message going in one direction followed by a UDP message
going in the other direction. It needs to deal with correctly
identifying processes on remote hosts and correlating requests with
responses. It may also need to overcome some or all of the limitations
of the underlying network outlined in the problem statement at the
beginning of this chapter. While TCP overcomes these limitations by
providing a reliable byte-stream service, it doesn&apos;t match the
request/reply paradigm very well either&#x2014;going to the trouble to
establish a TCP connection just to exchange a pair of messages seems
like overkill. This section describes a third category of transport
protocol, called <em>Remote Procedure Call</em> (RPC), that more closely
matches the needs of an application involved in a request/reply message
exchange.</p>
<h2 id="rpc-fundamentals">RPC Fundamentals</h2>
<p>RPC is actually more than just a protocol&#x2014;it is a popular mechanism
for structuring distributed systems. RPC is popular because it is based
on the semantics of a local procedure call&#x2014;the application program
makes a call into a procedure without regard for whether it is local or
remote and blocks until the call returns. An application developer can
be largely unaware of whether the procedure is local or remote,
simplifying his task considerably. When the procedures being called are
actually methods of remote objects in an object-oriented language, RPC
is known as <em>remote method invocation</em> (RMI). While the RPC concept is
simple, there are two main problems that make it more complicated than
local procedure calls:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The network between the calling process and the called process has
 much more complex properties than the backplane of a computer. For
 example, it is likely to limit message sizes and has a tendency to
 lose and reorder messages.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The computers on which the calling and called processes run may have
 significantly different architectures and data representation
 formats.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus, a complete RPC mechanism actually involves two major components:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>A protocol that manages the messages sent between the client and the
 server processes and that deals with the potentially undesirable
 properties of the underlying network</p>
</li>
<li><p>Programming language and compiler support to package the arguments
 into a request message on the client machine and then to translate
 this message back into the arguments on the server machine, and
 likewise with the return value (this piece of the RPC mechanism is
 usually called a <em>stub compiler</em>)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="#rpc-stub">Figure 2</a> schematically depicts what happens when a client
invokes a remote procedure. First, the client calls a local stub for the
procedure, passing it the arguments required by the procedure. This stub
hides the fact that the procedure is remote by translating the arguments
into a request message and then invoking an RPC protocol to send the
request message to the server machine. At the server, the RPC protocol
delivers the request message to the server stub (sometimes called a
<em>skeleton</em>), which translates it into the arguments to the procedure and
then calls the local procedure. After the server procedure completes, it
returns the answer to the server stub, which packages this return value
in a reply message that it hands off to the RPC protocol for
transmission back to the client. The RPC protocol on the client passes
this message up to the client stub, which translates it into a return
value that it returns to the client program.</p>

<p>This section considers just the protocol-related aspects of an RPC
mechanism. That is, it ignores the stubs and focuses instead on the RPC
protocol, sometimes referred to as a request/reply protocol, that
transmits messages between client and server. The transformation of
arguments into messages and <em>vice versa</em> is covered elsewhere.</p>
<p>The term <em>RPC</em> refers to a type of protocol rather than a specific
standard like TCP, so specific RPC protocols vary in the functions they
perform. And, unlike TCP, which is the dominant reliable byte-stream
protocol, there is no one dominant RPC protocol. Thus, in this section
we will talk more about alternative design choices than previously.</p>
<h3 id="identifiers-in-rpc">Identifiers in RPC</h3>
<p>Two functions that must be performed by any RPC protocol are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Provide a name space for uniquely identifying the procedure to be
 called.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Match each reply message to the corresponding request message.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The first problem has some similarities to the problem of identifying
nodes in a network, something that we saw in previous chapters (IP
addresses, for example). One of the design choices when identifying
things is whether to make this name space flat or hierarchical. A flat
name space would simply assign a unique, unstructured identifier (e.g.,
an integer) to each procedure, and this number would be carried in a
single field in an RPC request message. This would require some kind of
central coordination to avoid assigning the same procedure number to two
different procedures. Alternatively, the protocol could implement a
hierarchical name space, analogous to that used for file pathnames,
which requires only that a file&apos;s &quot;basename&quot; be unique within its
directory. This approach potentially simplifies the job of ensuring
uniqueness of procedure names. A hierarchical name space for RPC could
be implemented by defining a set of fields in the request message
format, one for each level of naming in, say, a two- or three-level
hierarchical name space.</p>
<p>The key to matching a reply message to the corresponding request is to
uniquely identify request-replies pairs using a message ID field. A
reply message had its message ID field set to the same value as the
request message. When the client RPC module receives the reply, it uses
the message ID to search for the corresponding outstanding request. To
make the RPC transaction appear like a local procedure call to the
caller, the caller is blocked (e.g., by using a semaphore) until the
reply message is received. When the reply is received, the blocked
caller is identified based on the request number in the reply, the
remote procedure&apos;s return value is obtained from the reply, and the
caller is unblocked so that it can return with that return value.</p>
<p>One of the recurrent challenges in RPC is dealing with unexpected
responses, and we see this with message IDs. For example, consider the
following pathological (but realistic) situation. A client machine sends
a request message with a message ID of $0$, then crashes and reboots,
and then sends an unrelated request message, also with a message ID of
$0$. The server may not have been aware that the client crashed and
rebooted and, upon seeing a request message with a message ID of $0$,
acknowledges it and discards it as a duplicate. The client never gets a
response to the request.</p>
<p>One way to eliminate this problem is to use a <em>boot ID</em>. A machine&apos;s
boot ID is a number that is incremented each time the machine reboots;
this number is read from nonvolatile storage (e.g., a disk or flash
drive), incremented, and written back to the storage device during the
machine&apos;s start-up procedure. This number is then put in every message
sent by that host. If a message is received with an old message ID but a
new boot ID, it is recognized as a new message. In effect, the message
ID and boot ID combine to form a unique ID for each transaction.</p>
<h3 id="overcoming-network-limitations">Overcoming Network Limitations</h3>
<p>RPC protocols often perform additional functions to deal with the fact
that networks are not perfect channels. Two such functions are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Provide reliable message delivery</p>
</li>
<li><p>Support large message sizes through fragmentation and reassembly</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>An RPC protocol might implement reliability because the underlying
protocols (e.g., UDP/IP) do not provide it, or perhaps to recover more
quickly or efficiently from failures that otherwise would eventually be
repaired by underlying protocols. An RPC protocol can implement
reliability using acknowledgments and timeouts, similarly to TCP. The
basic algorithm is straightforward, as illustrated by the timeline given
in <a href="#chan-timeline1">Figure 3</a>. The client sends a request message and
the server acknowledges it. Then, after executing the procedure, the
server sends a reply message and the client acknowledges the reply.</p>
<figure class="line">
    <a id="chan-timeline1"></a>
    <img src="figures/f05-15-9780123850591.png" width="200px">
    <figcaption>Simple timeline for a reliable RPC protocol.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Either a message carrying data (a request message or a reply message) or
the ACK sent to acknowledge that message may be lost in the network. To
account for this possibility, both client and server save a copy of each
message they send until an ACK for it has arrived. Each side also sets a
RETRANSMIT timer and resends the message should this timer expire. Both
sides reset this timer and try again some agreed-upon number of times
before giving up and freeing the message.</p>
<p>If an RPC client receives a reply message, clearly the corresponding
request message must have been received by the server. Hence, the reply
message itself is an <em>implicit acknowledgment</em>, and any additional
acknowledgment from the server is not logically necessary. Similarly, a
request message could implicitly acknowledge the preceding reply
message&#x2014;assuming the protocol makes request-reply transactions
sequential, so that one transaction must complete before the next
begins. Unfortunately, this sequentiality would severely limit RPC
performance.</p>
<p>A way out of this predicament is for the RPC protocol to implement a
<em>channel</em> abstraction. Within a given channel, request/reply
transactions are sequential&#x2014;there can be only one transaction active
on a given channel at any given time&#x2014;but there can be multiple
channels. Each message includes a channel ID field to indicate which
channel the message belongs to. A request message in a given channel
would implicitly acknowledge the previous reply in that channel, if it
hadn&apos;t already been acknowledged. An application program can open
multiple channels to a server if it wants to have more than one
request/reply transaction between them at the same time (the application
would need multiple threads). As illustrated in
<a href="#implicitAckTimeline">Figure 4</a>, the reply message serves to
acknowledge the request message, and a subsequent request acknowledges
the preceding reply. Note that we saw a very similar approach&#x2014;called
<em>concurrent logical channels</em>&#x2014;in a later section as a way to improve
on the performance of a stop-and-wait reliability mechanism.</p>
<figure class="line">

    <figcaption>Timeline for a reliable RPC protocol using implicit
    acknowledgment.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Another complication that RPC must address is that the server may take
an arbitrarily long time to produce the result, and, worse yet, it may
crash before generating the reply. Keep in mind that we are talking
about the period of time after the server has acknowledged the request
but before it has sent the reply. To help the client distinguish between
a slow server and a dead server, the RPC&apos;s client side can periodically
send an &quot;Are you alive?&quot; message to the server, and the server side
responds with an ACK. Alternatively, the server could send &quot;I am still
alive&quot; messages to the client without the client having first solicited
them. The approach is more scalable because it puts more of the
per-client burden (managing the timeout timer) on the clients.</p>
<p>RPC reliability may include the property known as <em>at-most-once
semantics</em>. This means that for every request message that the client
sends, at most one copy of that message is delivered to the server. Each
time the client calls a remote procedure, that procedure is invoked at
most one time on the server machine. We say &quot;at most once&quot; rather than
&quot;exactly once&quot; because it is always possible that either the network or
the server machine has failed, making it impossible to deliver even one
copy of the request message.</p>
<p>To implement at-most-once semantics, RPC on the server side must
recognize duplicate requests (and ignore them), even if it has already
successfully replied to the original request. Hence, it must maintain
some state information that identifies past requests. One approach is to
identify requests using sequence numbers, so a server need only remember
the most recent sequence number. Unfortunately, this would limit an RPC
to one outstanding request (to a given server) at a time, since one
request must be completed before the request with the next sequence
number can be transmitted. Once again, channels provide a solution. The
server could recognize duplicate requests by remembering the current
sequence number for each channel, without limiting the client to one
request at a time.</p>
<p>As obvious as at-most-once sounds, not all RPC protocols support this
behavior. Some support a semantics that is facetiously called
<em>zero-or-more</em> semantics; that is, each invocation on a client results
in the remote procedure being invoked zero or more times. It is not
difficult to understand how this would cause problems for a remote
procedure that changed some local state variable (e.g., incremented a
counter) or that had some externally visible side effect (e.g., launched
a missile) each time it was invoked. On the other hand, if the remote
procedure being invoked is <em>idempotent</em>&#x2014;multiple invocations have the
same effect as just one&#x2014;then the RPC mechanism need not support
at-most-once semantics; a simpler (possibly faster) implementation will
suffice.</p>
<p>As was the case with reliability, the two reasons why an RPC protocol
might implement message fragmentation and reassembly are that it is not
provided by the underlying protocol stack or that it can be implemented
more efficiently by the RPC protocol. Consider the case where RPC is
implemented on top of UDP/IP and relies on IP for fragmentation and
reassembly. If even one fragment of a message fails to arrive within a
certain amount of time, IP discards the fragments that did arrive and
the message is effectively lost. Eventually, the RPC protocol (assuming
it implements reliability) would time out and retransmit the message. In
contrast, consider an RPC protocol that implements its own fragmentation
and reassembly and aggressively ACKs or NACKs (negatively acknowledges)
individual fragments. Lost fragments would be more quickly detected and
retransmitted, and only the lost fragments would be retransmitted, not
the whole message.</p>
<h3 id="synchronous-versus-asynchronous-protocols">Synchronous versus Asynchronous Protocols</h3>
<p>One way to characterize a protocol is by whether it is <em>synchronous</em> or
<em>asynchronous</em>. The precise meaning of these terms depends on where in
the protocol hierarchy you use them. At the transport layer, it is most
accurate to think of them as defining the extremes of a spectrum rather
than as two mutually exclusive alternatives. The key attribute of any
point along the spectrum is how much the sending process knows after the
operation to send a message returns. In other words, if we assume that
an application program invokes a <code>send</code> operation on a transport
protocol, then exactly what does the application know about the success
of the operation when the <code>send</code> operation returns?</p>
<p>At the <em>asynchronous</em> end of the spectrum, the application knows
absolutely nothing when <code>send</code> returns. Not only does it not know if
the message was received by its peer, but it doesn&apos;t even know for sure
that the message has successfully left the local machine. At the
<em>synchronous</em> end of the spectrum, the <code>send</code> operation typically
returns a reply message. That is, the application not only knows that
the message it sent was received by its peer, but it also knows that the
peer has returned an answer. Thus, synchronous protocols implement the
request/reply abstraction, while asynchronous protocols are used if the
sender wants to be able to transmit many messages without having to wait
for a response. Using this definition, RPC protocols are obviously
synchronous protocols.</p>
<p>Although we have not discussed them in this chapter, there are
interesting points between these two extremes. For example, the
transport protocol might implement <code>send</code> so that it blocks (does not
return) until the message has been successfully received at the remote
machine, but returns before the sender&apos;s peer on that machine has
actually processed and responded to it. This is sometimes called a
<em>reliable datagram protocol</em>.</p>
<h2 id="rpc-implementations-sunrpc-dce">RPC Implementations (SunRPC, DCE)</h2>
<p>We now turn our discussion to some example implementations of RPC
protocols. These will serve to highlight some of the different design
decisions that protocol designers have made. Our first example is
SunRPC, a widely used RPC protocol also known as Open Network Computing
RPC (ONC RPC). Our second example, which we will refer to as DCE-RPC, is
part of the Distributed Computing Environment (DCE). DCE is a set of
standards and software for building distributed systems that was defined
by the Open Software Foundation (OSF), a consortium of computer
companies that originally included IBM, Digital Equipment Corporation,
and Hewlett-Packard; today, OSF goes by the name The Open Group. These
two examples represent interesting alternative design choices in the RPC
solution space.</p>

    <figcaption>Protocol graph for SunRPC on top of UDP.</figcaption>
</figure>

<h3 id="sunrpc">SunRPC</h3>
<p>SunRPC became a <em>de facto</em> standard thanks to its wide distribution with
Sun workstations and the central role it plays in Sun&apos;s popular Network
File System (NFS). The IETF subsequently adopted it as a standard
Internet protocol under the name ONC RPC.</p>
<p>SunRPC can be implemented over several different transport protocols.
<a href="#sunrpc">Figure 5</a> illustrates the protocol graph when SunRPC is
implemented on UDP. As we noted earlier in this section, a strict
layerist might frown on the idea of running a transport protocol over a
transport protocol, or argue that RPC must be something other than a
transport protocol since it appears &quot;above&quot; the transport layer.
Pragmatically, the design decision to run RPC over an existing transport
layer makes quite a lot of sense, as will be apparent in the following
discussion.</p>
<p>SunRPC uses two-tier identifiers to identify remote procedures: a 32-bit
program number and a 32-bit procedure number. (There is also a 32-bit
version number, but we ignore that in the following discussion.) For
example, the NFS server has been assigned program number <code>x00100003</code>,
and within this program <code>getattr</code> is procedure <code>1</code>, <code>setattr</code> is
procedure <code>2</code>, <code>read</code> is procedure <code>6</code>, <code>write</code> is procedure
<code>8</code>, and so on. The program number and procedure number are
transmitted in the SunRPC request message&apos;s header, whose fields are
shown in <a href="#sunrpc-format">Figure 6</a>. The server&#x2014;which may support
several program numbers&#x2014;is responsible for calling the specified
procedure of the specified program. A SunRPC request really represents a
request to call the specified program and procedure on the particular
machine to which the request was sent, even though the same program
number may be implemented on other machines in the same network. Thus,
the address of the server&apos;s machine (e.g., an IP address) is an implicit
third tier of the RPC address.</p>
<figure class="line">
    <a id="sunrpc-format"></a>
    <img src="figures/f05-18-9780123850591.png" width="400px">
    <figcaption>SunRPC header formats: (a) request; (b) reply.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Different program numbers may belong to different servers on the same
machine. These different servers have different transport layer demux
keys (e.g., UDP ports), most of which are not well-known numbers but
instead are assigned dynamically. These demux keys are called <em>transport
selectors</em>. How can a SunRPC client that wants to talk to a particular
program determine which transport selector to use to reach the
corresponding server? The solution is to assign a well-known address to
<em>just one</em> program on the remote machine and let that program handle the
task of telling clients which transport selector to use to reach any
other program on the machine. The original version of this SunRPC
program is called the <em>Port Mapper</em>, and it supports only UDP and TCP as
underlying protocols. Its program number is <code>x00100000</code>, and its
well-known port is <code>111</code>. RPCBIND, which evolved from the Port Mapper,
supports arbitrary underlying transport protocols. As each SunRPC server
starts, it calls an RPCBIND registration procedure, on the server&apos;s own
home machine, to register its transport selector and the program numbers
that it supports. A remote client can then call an RPCBIND lookup
procedure to look up the transport selector for a particular program
number.</p>
<p>To make this more concrete, consider an example using the Port Mapper
with UDP. To send a request message to NFS&apos;s <code>read</code> procedure, a
client first sends a request message to the Port Mapper at well-known
UDP port <code>111</code>, asking that procedure <code>3</code> be invoked to map program
number <code>x00100003</code> to the UDP port where the NFS program currently
resides. The client then sends a SunRPC request message with program
number <code>x00100003</code> and procedure number <code>6</code> to this UDP port, and
the SunRPC module listening at that port calls the NFS <code>read</code>
procedure. The client also caches the program-to-port number mapping so
that it need not go back to the Port Mapper each time it wants to talk
to the NFS program.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In practice, NFS is such an important program that it has been 
given its own well-known UDP port, but for the purposes of 
illustration we&apos;re pretending that&apos;s not the case. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>To match up a reply message with the corresponding request, so that the
result of the RPC can be returned to the correct caller, both request
and reply message headers include a <code>XID</code> (transaction ID) field, as
in <a href="#sunrpc-format">Figure 6</a>. A <code>XID</code> is a unique transaction ID
used only by one request and the corresponding reply. After the server
has successfully replied to a given request, it does not remember the
<code>XID</code>. Because of this, SunRPC cannot guarantee at-most-once
semantics.</p>
<p>The details of SunRPC&apos;s semantics depend on the underlying transport
protocol. It does not implement its own reliability, so it is only
reliable if the underlying transport is reliable. (Of course, any
application that runs over SunRPC may also choose to implement its own
reliability mechanisms above the level of SunRPC.) The ability to send
request and reply messages that are larger than the network MTU is also
dependent on the underlying transport. In other words, SunRPC does not
make any attempt to improve on the underlying transport when it comes to
reliability and message size. Since SunRPC can run over many different
transport protocols, this gives it considerable flexibility without
complicating the design of the RPC protocol itself.</p>
<p>Returning to the SunRPC header format of <a href="#sunrpc-format">Figure 6</a>,
the request message contains variable-length <code>Credentials</code> and
<code>Verifier</code> fields, both of which are used by the client to
authenticate itself to the server&#x2014;that is, to give evidence that the
client has the right to invoke the server. How a client authenticates
itself to a server is a general issue that must be addressed by any
protocol that wants to provide a reasonable level of security. This
topic is discussed in more detail in another chapter.</p>
<h3 id="dce-rpc">DCE-RPC</h3>
<p>DCE-RPC is the RPC protocol at the core of the DCE system and was the
basis of the RPC mechanism underlying Microsoft&apos;s DCOM and ActiveX. It
can be used with the Network Data Representation (NDR) stub compiler
described in another chapter, but it also serves as the underlying RPC
protocol for the Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA),
which is an industry-wide standard for building distributed,
object-oriented systems.</p>
<p>DCE-RPC, like SunRPC, can be implemented on top of several transport
protocols including UDP and TCP. It is also similar to SunRPC in that it
defines a two-level addressing scheme: the transport protocol
demultiplexes to the correct server, DCE-RPC dispatches to a particular
procedure exported by that server, and clients consult an &quot;endpoint
mapping service&quot; (similar to SunRPC&apos;s Port Mapper) to learn how to reach
a particular server. Unlike SunRPC, however, DCE-RPC implements
at-most-once call semantics. (In truth, DCE-RPC supports multiple call
semantics, including an idempotent semantics similar to SunRPC&apos;s, but
at-most-once is the default behavior.) There are some other differences
between the two approaches, which we will highlight in the following
paragraphs.</p>
<figure class="line">
    <a id="dce"></a>
    <img src="figures/f05-19-9780123850591.png" width="200px">
    <figcaption>Typical DCE-RPC message exchange.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p><a href="#dce">Figure 7</a> gives a timeline for the typical exchange of
messages, where each message is labeled by its DCE-RPC type. The client
sends a <code>Request</code> message, the server eventually replies with a
<code>Response</code> message, and the client acknowledges (<code>Ack</code>) the
response. Instead of the server acknowledging the request messages,
however, the client periodically sends a <code>Ping</code> message to the server,
which responds with a <code>Working</code> message to indicate that the remote
procedure is still in progress. If the server&apos;s reply is received
reasonably quickly, no <code>Ping</code>s are sent. Although not shown in the
figure, other message types are also supported. For example, the client
can send a <code>Quit</code> message to the server, asking it to abort an earlier
call that is still in progress; the server responds with a <code>Quack</code>
(quit acknowledgment) message. Also, the server can respond to a
<code>Request</code> message with a <code>Reject</code> message (indicating that a call
has been rejected), and it can respond to a <code>Ping</code> message with a
<code>Nocall</code> message (indicating that the server has never heard of the
caller).</p>
<p>Each request/reply transaction in DCE-RPC takes place in the context of
an <em>activity</em>. An activity is a logical request/reply channel between a
pair of participants. At any given time, there can be only one message
transaction active on a given channel. Like the concurrent logical
channel approach described above, the application programs have to open
multiple channels if they want to have more than one request/reply
transaction between them at the same time. The activity to which a
message belongs is identified by the message&apos;s <code>ActivityId</code> field. A
<code>SequenceNum</code> field then distinguishes between calls made as part of
the same activity; it serves the same purpose as SunRPC&apos;s <code>XID</code>
(transaction id) field. Unlike SunRPC, DCE-RPC keeps track of the last
sequence number used as part of a particular activity, so as to ensure
at-most-once semantics. To distinguish between replies sent before and
after a server machine reboots, DCE-RPC uses a <code>ServerBoot</code> field to
hold the machine&apos;s boot ID.</p>
<p>Another design choice made in DCE-RPC that differs from SunRPC is the
support of fragmentation and reassembly in the RPC protocol. As noted
above, even if an underlying protocol such as IP provides
fragmentation/reassembly, a more sophisticated algorithm implemented as
part of RPC can result in quicker recovery and reduced bandwidth
consumption when fragments are lost. The <code>FragmentNum</code> field uniquely
identifies each fragment that makes up a given request or reply message.
Each DCE-RPC fragment is assigned a unique fragment number (0, 1, 2, 3,
and so on). Both the client and server implement a selective
acknowledgment mechanism, which works as follows. (We describe the
mechanism in terms of a client sending a fragmented request message to
the server; the same mechanism applies when a server sends a fragment
response to the client.)</p>
<p>First, each fragment that makes up the request message contains both a
unique <code>FragmentNum</code> and a flag indicating whether this packet is a
fragment of a call (<code>frag</code>) or the last fragment of a call (); request
messages that fit in a single packet carry a flag. The server knows it
has received the complete request message when it has the packet and
there are no gaps in the fragment numbers. Second, in response to each
arriving fragment, the server sends a <code>Fack</code> (fragment acknowledgment)
message to the client. This acknowledgment identifies the highest
fragment number that the server has successfully received. In other
words, the acknowledgment is cumulative, much like in TCP. In addition,
however, the server selectively acknowledges any higher fragment numbers
it has received out of order. It does so with a bit vector that
identifies these out-of-order fragments relative to the highest in-order
fragment it has received. Finally, the client responds by retransmitting
the missing fragments.</p>
<p><a href="#fack">Figure 8</a> illustrates how this all works. Suppose the
server has successfully received fragments up through number 20, plus
fragments 23, 25, and 26. The server responds with a <code>Fack</code> that
identifies fragment 20 as the highest in-order fragment, plus a
bit-vector (<code>SelAck</code>) with the third $(23=20+3)$, fifth $(25=20+5)$,
and sixth $(26=20+6)$ bits turned on. So as to support an (almost)
arbitrarily long bit vector, the size of the vector (measured in 32-bit
words) is given in the <code>SelAckLen</code> field.</p>
<figure class="line">
    <a id="fack"></a>
    <img src="figures/f05-20-9780123850591.png" width="500px">
    <figcaption>Fragmentation with selective acknowledgments.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Given DCE-RPC&apos;s support for very large messages&#x2014;the <code>FragmentNum</code>
field is 16 bits long, meaning it can support 64K fragments&#x2014;it is not
appropriate for the protocol to blast all the fragments that make up a
message as fast as it can since doing so might overrun the receiver.
Instead, DCE-RPC implements a flow-control algorithm that is very
similar to TCP&apos;s. Specifically, each <code>Fack</code> message not only
acknowledges received fragments but also informs the sender of how many
fragments it may now send. This is the purpose of the <code>WindowSize</code>
field in <a href="#fack">Figure 8</a>, which serves exactly the same purpose
as TCP&apos;s <code>AdvertisedWindow</code> field except it counts fragments rather
than bytes. DCE-RPC also implements a congestion-control mechanism that
is similar to TCP&apos;s. Given the complexity of congestion control, it is
perhaps not surprising that some RPC protocols avoid it by avoiding
fragmentation.</p>
<p>In summary, designers have quite a range of options open to them when
designing an RPC protocol. SunRPC takes the more minimalist approach and
adds relatively little to the underlying transport beyond the essentials
of locating the right procedure and identifying messages. DCE-RPC adds
more functionality, with the possibility of improved performance in some
environments at the cost of greater complexity.</p>
