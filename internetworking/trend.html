<h1>Perspective: Virtual Networks All the Way Down<a class="headerlink" href="#perspective-virtual-networks-all-the-way-down" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>For almost as long as there have been packet-switched networks, there
have been ideas about how to virtualize them, starting with virtual
circuits. But what exactly does it mean to virtualize a network?</p>
<p>Virtual memory is a helpful example. Virtual memory creates an
abstraction of a large and private pool of memory, even though the
underlying physical memory may be shared by many applications and
considerably smaller that the apparent pool of virtual memory. This
abstraction enables programmers to operate under the illusion that there
is plenty of memory and that no-one else is using it, while under the
covers the memory management system takes care of things like mapping
the virtual memory to physical resources and avoiding conflict between
users.</p>
<p>Similarly, server virtualization presents the abstraction of a virtual
machine (VM), which has all the features of a physical machine. Again,
there may be many VMs supported on a single physical server, and the
operating system and users on the virtual machine are happily unaware
that the VM is being mapped onto physical resources.</p>
<p>A key point is the virtualization of computing resources preserves the
abstractions and interfaces that existed before they were virtualized.
This is important because it means that users of those abstractions
don’t need to change—they see a faithful reproduction of the resource
being virtualized. Virtualization also means that the different users
(sometimes called <em>tenants</em>) cannot interfere with each other. So what
happens when we try to virtualize a network?</p>
<p>VPNs, as described in <a class="reference internal" href="basic-ip.html#internet-ip"><span class="std std-ref">Section 3.3</span></a>,
were one early success for virtual networking. They allowed carriers
to present corporate customers with the illusion that they had their
own private network, even though in reality they were sharing
underlying links and switches with many other users. VPNs, however,
only virtualize a few resources, notably addressing and routing
tables. Network virtualization as commonly understood today goes
further, virtualizing every aspect of networking. That means that a
virtual network should support all the basic abstractions of a
physical network. In this sense, they are analogous to the virtual
machine, with its support of all the resources of a server: CPU,
storage, I/O, and so on.</p>
<p>To this end, VLANS, as described in <a class="reference internal" href="ethernet.html#switched-ethernet"><span class="std std-ref">Section 3.2</span></a>, are how we typically virtualize an L2 network. VLANs
proved to be quite useful to enterprises that wanted to isolate
different internal groups (e.g., departments, labs), giving each of
them the appearance of having their own private LAN. VLANs were also
seen as a promising way to virtualize L2 networks in cloud
datacenters, making it possible to give each tenant their own L2
network so as to isolate their traffic from the traffic of all other
tenants. But there was a problem: the 4096 possible VLANs was not
sufficient to account for all the tenants that a cloud might host, and
to complicate matters, in a cloud the network needs to connect
<em>virtual machines</em> rather than the physical machines that those VMs
run on.</p>
<p>To address this problem, another standard called <em>Virtual Extensible
LAN</em> (VXLAN) was introduced. Unlike the original approach, which
effectively encapsulated a virtualized ethernet frame inside another
ethernet frame, VXLAN encapsulates a virtual ethernet frame inside a UDP
packet. This means a VXLAN-based virtual network (which is often
referred to as an <em>overlay network</em>) runs on top of an IP-based network,
which in turn runs on an underlying ethernet (or perhaps in just one
VLAN of the underlying ethernet). VXLAN also makes it possible for one
cloud tenant to have multiple VLANs of their own, which allows them to
segregate their own internal traffic. This means it is ultimately
possible to have a VLAN encapsulated in a VXLAN overlay encapsulated in
a VLAN.</p>
<p>The powerful thing about virtualization is that when done right, it
should be possible to nest one virtualized resource inside another
virtualized resource, since after all, a virtual resource should behave
just like a physical resources and we know how to virtualize physical
resources! Said another way, being able to virtualize a virtual resource
is the best proof that you have done a good job of virtualizing the
original physical resource. To re-purpose the mythology of the World
Turtle: It’s virtual networks all the way down.</p>

header.</span></p>
</div>
<p>The actual VXLAN header is simple, as shown in <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-vxlan"><span class="std std-numref">Figure 96</span></a>. It includes a 24-bit <em>Virtual Network Id</em> (VNI), plus
some flag and reserved bits. It also implies a particular setting of
the UDP source and destination port fields (see <a class="reference internal" href="../e2e/udp.html#simple-demultiplexor-udp"><span class="std std-ref">Section 5.1</span></a>), with the destination port 4789
officially reserved for VXLANs. Figuring out how to uniquely identify
virtual LANs (VLAN tags) and virtual networks (VXLAN VIDs) is the easy
part. This is because encapsulation is the fundamental cornerstone of
virtualization; all you need to add is an identifier that tells you
which of many possible users this encapsulated packet belongs to.</p>
<p>The hard part is grappling with the idea of virtual networks being
nested (encapsulated) inside virtual networks, which is networking’s
version of recursion. The other challenge is understanding how to
automate the creation, management, migration, and deletion of virtual
networks, and on this front there is still a lot of room for
improvement. Mastering this challenge will be at the heart of networking
in the next decade, and while some of this work will undoubtedly happen
in proprietary settings, there are open source network virtualization
platforms (e.g., the Linux Foundation’s <em>Tungsten Fabric</em> project)
leading the way.</p>
