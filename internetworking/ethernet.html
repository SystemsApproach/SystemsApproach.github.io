<h1>3.2 Switched Ethernet<a class="headerlink" href="#switched-ethernet" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Having discussed some of the basic ideas behind switching, we now
focus more closely on a specific switching technology: <em>Switched
Ethernet</em>. The switches used to build such networks, which are often
referred to as <em>L2 switches</em>, are widely used in campus and enterprise
networks. Historically, they were more commonly referred to as
<em>bridges</em> because they were used to “bridge” ethernet segments to
build an <em>extended LAN</em>. But today most networks deploy Ethernet in a
point-to-point configuration, with these links interconneted by L2
switches to form a switched Ethernet.</p>
<p>The following starts with the historical perspective (using bridges to
connect a set of Ethernet segments), and then shifts to the perspective
in wide-spread use today (using L2 switches to connect a set of
point-to-point links). But whether we call the device a bridge or a
switch—and the network you build an extended LAN or a switched
Ethernet—the two behave in <em>exactly</em> the same way.</p>
<p>To begin, suppose you have a pair of Ethernets that you want to
interconnect. One approach you might try is to put a repeater between
them. This would not be a workable solution, however, if doing so
exceeded the physical limitations of the Ethernet. (Recall that no more
than two repeaters between any pair of hosts and no more than a total of
2500&nbsp;m in length are allowed.) An alternative would be to put a node
with a pair of Ethernet adaptors between the two Ethernets and have the
node forward frames from one Ethernet to the other. This node would
differ from a repeater, which operates on bits, not frames, and just
blindly copies the bits received on one interface to another. Instead,
this node would fully implement the Ethernet’s collision detection and
media access protocols on each interface. Hence, the length and
number-of-host restrictions of the Ethernet, which are all about
managing collisions, would not apply to the combined pair of Ethernets
connected in this way. This device operates in promiscuous mode,
accepting all frames transmitted on either of the Ethernets, and
forwarding them to the other.</p>
<p>In their simplest variants, bridges simply accept LAN frames on their
inputs and forward them out on all other outputs. This simple strategy
was used by early bridges but has some pretty serious limitations as
we’ll see below. A number of refinements were added over the years
to make bridges an effective mechanism for interconnecting a set of
LANs. The rest of this section fills in the more interesting details.</p>
<div class="section" id="learning-bridges">
<h2>Learning Bridges<a class="headerlink" href="#learning-bridges" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The first optimization we can make to a bridge is to observe that it
need not forward all frames that it receives. Consider the bridge in
<a class="reference internal" href="#fig-elan2"><span class="std std-numref">Figure 64</span></a>. Whenever a frame from host&nbsp;A that is
addressed to host&nbsp;B arrives on port&nbsp;1, there is no need for the bridge
to forward the frame out over port&nbsp;2. The question, then, is how does
a bridge come to learn on which port the various hosts reside?</p>
<div class="figure align-center" id="id1">
<span id="fig-elan2"></span><a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/f03-09-9780123850591.png"><img alt="../_images/f03-09-9780123850591.png" src="../_images/f03-09-9780123850591.png" style="width: 500px;" /></a>
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-number">Figure 64. </span><span class="caption-text">Illustration of a learning bridge.</span></p>
</div>
<p>One option would be to have a human download a table into the bridge
similar to the one given in <a class="reference internal" href="#tab-learn"><span class="std std-numref">Table 9</span></a>. Then,
whenever the bridge receives a frame on port&nbsp;1 that is addressed to
host&nbsp;A, it would not forward the frame out on port&nbsp;2; there would be
no need because host&nbsp;A would have already directly received the frame
on the LAN connected to port&nbsp;1. Anytime a frame addressed to host&nbsp;A
was received on port&nbsp;2, the bridge would forward the frame out on
port&nbsp;1.</p>
<span id="tab-learn"></span><table border="1" class="colwidths-auto docutils align-center" id="id2">
<caption><span class="caption-number">Table 9. </span><span class="caption-text">Forwarding Table Maintained by a Bridge.</span><a class="headerlink" href="#id2" title="Permalink to this table">¶</a></caption>

</table>
<p>Having a human maintain this table is too burdensome, and there is a
simple trick by which a bridge can learn this information for itself.
The idea is for each bridge to inspect the <em>source</em> address in all the
frames it receives. Thus, when host&nbsp;A sends a frame to a host on either
side of the bridge, the bridge receives this frame and records the fact
that a frame from host A was just received on port&nbsp;1. In this way, the
bridge can build a table just like <a class="reference internal" href="#tab-learn"><span class="std std-numref">Table 9</span></a>.</p>
<p>Note that a bridge using such a table implements a version of the
datagram (or connectionless) model of forwarding described earlier. Each
packet carries a global address, and the bridge decides which output to
send a packet on by looking up that address in a table.</p>
<p>When a bridge first boots, this table is empty; entries are added over
time. Also, a timeout is associated with each entry, and the bridge
discards the entry after a specified period of time. This is to protect
against the situation in which a host—and, as a consequence, its LAN
address—is moved from one network to another. Thus, this table is not
necessarily complete. Should the bridge receive a frame that is
addressed to a host not currently in the table, it goes ahead and
forwards the frame out on all the other ports. In other words, this
table is simply an optimization that filters out some frames; it is not
required for correctness.</p>

<div class="section" id="implementation">
<h2>Implementation<a class="headerlink" href="#implementation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The code that implements the learning bridge algorithm is quite
simple, and we sketch it here. Structure <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">BridgeEntry</span></code> defines a
single entry in the bridge’s forwarding table; these are stored in a
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Map</span></code> structure (which supports <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">mapCreate</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">mapBind</span></code>, and
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">mapResolve</span></code> operations) to enable entries to be efficiently located
when packets arrive from sources already in the table. The constant
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">MAX_TTL</span></code> specifies how long an entry is kept in the table before it
is discarded.</p>

<p>The routine that updates the forwarding table when a new packet arrives
is given by <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">updateTable</span></code>. The arguments passed are the source media
access control (MAC) address contained in the packet and the interface
number on which it was received. Another routine, not shown here, is
invoked at regular intervals, scans the entries in the forwarding table,
and decrements the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">TTL</span></code> (time to live) field of each entry,
discarding any entries whose <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">TTL</span></code> has reached&nbsp;0. Note that the
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">TTL</span></code> is reset to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">MAX_TTL</span></code> every time a packet arrives to refresh
an existing table entry and that the interface on which the destination

<p>Note that this implementation adopts a simple strategy in the case where
the bridge table has become full to capacity—it simply fails to add the
new address. Recall that completeness of the bridge table is not
necessary for correct forwarding; it just optimizes performance. If
there is some entry in the table that is not currently being used, it
will eventually time out and be removed, creating space for a new entry.
An alternative approach would be to invoke some sort of cache
replacement algorithm on finding the table full; for example, we might
locate and remove the entry with the smallest TTL to accommodate the new
entry.</p>

<div class="section" id="spanning-tree-algorithm">
<h2>Spanning Tree Algorithm<a class="headerlink" href="#spanning-tree-algorithm" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The preceding strategy works just fine until the network has a loop in
it, in which case it fails in a horrible way—frames potentially get
forwarded forever. This is easy to see in the example depicted in
<a class="reference internal" href="#fig-elan3"><span class="std std-numref">Figure 65</span></a>, where switches S1, S4, and S6 form a&nbsp;loop.</p>
<div class="figure align-center" id="id3">
<span id="fig-elan3"></span><a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/Slide5.png"><img alt="../_images/Slide5.png" src="../_images/Slide5.png" style="width: 500px;" /></a>
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-number">Figure 65. </span><span class="caption-text">Switched Ethernet with loops.</span></p>
</div>
<p>Note that we are now making the shift from calling the each forwarding
device a bridge (connecting segments that might reach multiple other
devices) to instead calling them L2 switches (connecting point-to-point
links that reach just one other device). To keep the example managable,
we include just three hosts. In practice, switches typically have 16,
24, or 48 ports, meaning they are able to connect to that many hosts
(and other swiches).</p>
<p>In our example switched network, suppose that a packet enters switch S4
from Host C and that the destination address is one not yet in any
switches’s forwarding table: S4 sends a copy of the packet out its two
other ports: to switches S1 and S6. Switch S6 forwards the packet onto
S1 (and meanwhile, S1 forwards the packet onto S6), both of which in
turn forward their packets back to S4. Switch S4 still doesn’t have this
destination in its table, so it forwards the packet out its two other
ports. There is nothing to stop this cycle from repeating endlessly,
with packets looping in both directions among S1, S4, and S6.</p>
<p>Why would a switched Ethernet (or extended LAN) come to have a loop in
it? One possibility is that the network is managed by more than one
administrator, for example, because it spans multiple departments in an
organization. In such a setting, it is possible that no single person
knows the entire configuration of the network, meaning that a switch
that closes a loop might be added without anyone knowing. A second, more
likely scenario is that loops are built into the network on purpose—to
provide redundancy in case of failure. After all, a network with no
loops needs only one link failure to become split into two separate
partitions.</p>
<p>Whatever the cause, switches must be able to correctly handle loops.
This problem is addressed by having the switches run a distributed
<em>spanning tree</em> algorithm. If you think of the network as being
represented by a graph that possibly has loops (cycles), then a
spanning tree is a subgraph of this graph that covers (spans) all the
vertices but contains no cycles. That is, a spanning tree keeps all of
the vertices of the original graph but throws out some of the
edges. For example, <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-graphs"><span class="std std-numref">Figure 66</span></a> shows a cyclic
graph on the left and one of possibly many spanning trees on the
right.</p>

<p>The idea of a spanning tree is simple enough: It’s a subset of the
actual network topology that has no loops and that reaches all the
devices in the network. The hard part is how all of the switches
coordinate their decisions to arrive at a single view of the spanning
tree. After all, one topology is typically able to be covered by
multiple spanning trees. The answer lies in the spanning tree protocol,
which we’ll describe now.</p>
<p>The spanning tree algorithm, which was developed by Radia Perlman, then
at the Digital Equipment Corporation, is a protocol used by a set of
switches to agree upon a spanning tree for a particular network. (The
IEEE 802.1 specification is based on this algorithm.) In practice, this
means that each switch decides the ports over which it is and is not
willing to forward frames. In a sense, it is by removing ports from the
topology that the network is reduced to an acyclic tree. It is even
possible that an entire switch will not participate in forwarding
frames, which seems kind of strange at first glance. The algorithm is
dynamic, however, meaning that the switches are always prepared to
reconfigure themselves into a new spanning tree should some switch fail,
and so those unused ports and switches provide the redundant capacity
needed to recover from failures.</p>
<p>The main idea of the spanning tree is for the switches to select the
ports over which they will forward frames. The algorithm selects ports
as follows. Each switch has a unique identifier; for our purposes, we
use the labels S1, S2, S3, and so on. The algorithm first elects the
switch with the smallest ID as the root of the spanning tree; exactly
how this election takes place is described below. The root switch always
forwards frames out over all of its ports. Next, each switch computes
the shortest path to the root and notes which of its ports is on this
path. This port is also selected as the switch’s preferred path to the
root. Finally, to account for the possibility there could be another
switch connected to its ports, the switch elect a single <em>designated</em>
switch that will be responsible for forwarding frames toward the root.
Each designated switch is the one that is closest to the root. If two or
more switches are equally close to the root, then the switches’
identifiers are used to break ties, and the smallest ID wins. Of course,
each switch might be connected to more than one other switch, so it
participates in the election of a designated switch for each such port.
In effect, this means that each switch decides if it is the designated
switch relative to each of its ports. The switch forwards frames over
those ports for which it is the designated switch.</p>

</div>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="#fig-elan4"><span class="std std-numref">Figure 67</span></a> shows the spanning tree that
corresponds to the network shown in <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-elan3"><span class="std std-numref">Figure 65</span></a>. In this example, S1 is the root, since it has the
smallest ID. Notice that S3 and S5 are connected to each other, but S5
is the designated switch since it is closer to the root. Similarly, S5
and S7 are connected to each other, but in this case S5 is the
designated switch since it has the smaller ID; both are an equal
distance from S1.</p>
<p>While it is possible for a human to look at the network given in
<a class="reference internal" href="#fig-elan3"><span class="std std-numref">Figure 65</span></a> and to compute the spanning tree given
in the <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-elan4"><span class="std std-numref">Figure 67</span></a> according to the rules given
above, the switches do not have the luxury of being able to see the
topology of the entire network, let alone peek inside other switches
to see their ID. Instead, they have to exchange configuration messages
with each other and then decide whether or not they are the root or a
designated switch based on these messages.</p>
<p>Specifically, the configuration messages contain three pieces of
information:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>The ID for the switch that is sending the message.</li>
<li>The ID for what the sending switch believes to be the root switch.</li>
<li>The distance, measured in hops, from the sending switch to the root
switch.</li>
</ol>
<p>Each switch records the current <em>best</em> configuration message it has seen
on each of its ports (“best” is defined below), including both messages
it has received from other switches and messages that it has itself
transmitted.</p>
<p>Initially, each switch thinks it is the root, and so it sends a
configuration message out on each of its ports identifying itself as the
root and giving a distance to the root of 0. Upon receiving a
configuration message over a particular port, the switch checks to see
if that new message is better than the current best configuration
message recorded for that port. The new configuration message is
considered <em>better</em> than the currently recorded information if any of
the following is true:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>It identifies a root with a smaller ID.</li>
<li>It identifies a root with an equal ID but with a shorter distance.</li>
<li>The root ID and distance are equal, but the sending switch has a
smaller ID</li>
</ul>
<p>If the new message is better than the currently recorded information,
the switch discards the old information and saves the new information.
However, it first adds 1 to the distance-to-root field since the switch
is one hop farther away from the root than the switch that sent the
message.</p>
<p>When a switch receives a configuration message indicating that it is not
the root—that is, a message from a switch with a smaller ID—the switch
stops generating configuration messages on its own and instead only
forwards configuration messages from other switches, after first adding
1 to the distance field. Likewise, when a switch receives a
configuration message that indicates it is not the designated switch for
that port—that is, a message from a switch that is closer to the root or
equally far from the root but with a smaller ID—the switch stops sending
configuration messages over that port. Thus, when the system stabilizes,
only the root switch is still generating configuration messages, and the
other switches are forwarding these messages only over ports for which
they are the designated switch. At this point, a spanning tree has been
built, and all the switches are in agreement on which ports are in use
for the spanning tree. Only those ports may be used for forwarding data
packets.</p>
<p>Let’s see how this works with an example. Consider what would happen in
<a class="reference internal" href="#fig-elan4"><span class="std std-numref">Figure 67</span></a> if the power had just been restored to a campus,
so that all the switches boot at about the same time. All the switches
would start off by claiming to be the root. We denote a configuration
message from node X in which it claims to be distance d from root node Y
as (Y,d,X). Focusing on the activity at S3, a sequence of events would
unfold as follows:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>S3 receives (S2,&nbsp;0,&nbsp;S2).</li>
<li>Since 2 &lt; 3, S3 accepts S2 as root.</li>
<li>S3 adds one to the distance advertised by S2 (0) and thus sends
(S2,&nbsp;1,&nbsp;S3) toward S5.</li>
<li>Meanwhile, S2 accepts S1 as root because it has the lower ID, and it
sends (S1,&nbsp;1,&nbsp;S2) toward S3.</li>
<li>S5 accepts S1 as root and sends (S1,&nbsp;1,&nbsp;S5) toward S3.</li>
<li>S3 accepts S1 as root, and it notes that both S2 and S5 are closer to
the root than it is, but S2 has the smaller id, so it remains on S3’s
path to the root.</li>
</ol>
<p>This leaves S3 with active ports as shown in <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-elan4"><span class="std std-numref">Figure 67</span></a>.
Note that Hosts A an B are not able to communication over the shortest
path (via S5) because frames have to “flow up the tree and back down,”
but that’s the price you pay to avoid loops.</p>
<p>Even after the system has stabilized, the root switch continues to send
configuration messages periodically, and the other switches continue to
forward these messages as just described. Should a particular switch
fail, the downstream switches will not receive these configuration
messages, and after waiting a specified period of time they will once
again claim to be the root, and the algorithm will kick in again to
elect a new root and new designated switches.</p>
<p>One important thing to notice is that although the algorithm is able to
reconfigure the spanning tree whenever a switch fails, it is not able to
forward frames over alternative paths for the sake of routing around a
congested switch.</p>

<div class="section" id="broadcast-and-multicast">
<h2>Broadcast and Multicast<a class="headerlink" href="#broadcast-and-multicast" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The preceding discussion focuses on how switches forward unicast
frames from one port to another. Since the goal of a switch is to
transparently extend a LAN across multiple networks, and since most LANs
support both broadcast and multicast, then switches must also support
these two features. Broadcast is simple—each switch forwards a frame
with a destination broadcast address out on each active (selected) port
other than the one on which the frame was received.</p>
<p>Multicast can be implemented in exactly the same way, with each host
deciding for itself whether or not to accept the message. This is
exactly what is done in practice. Notice, however, that since not all
hosts are a member of any particular multicast group, it is possible
to do better. Specifically, the spanning tree algorithm can be
extended to prune networks over which multicast frames need not be
forwarded.  Consider a frame sent to group M by a host A in
<a class="reference internal" href="#fig-elan4"><span class="std std-numref">Figure 67</span></a>.  If host C does not belong to group
M, then there is no need for switch S4 to forward the frames over that
network.</p>
<p>How would a given switch learn whether it should forward a multicast
frame over a given port? It learns exactly the same way that a switch
learns whether it should forward a unicast frame over a particular
port—by observing the <em>source</em> addresses that it receives over that
port. Of course, groups are not typically the source of frames, so we
have to cheat a little. In particular, each host that is a member of
group M must periodically send a frame with the address for group M in
the source field of the frame header. This frame would have as its
destination address the multicast address for the switches.</p>
<p>Although the multicast extension just described was once proposed, it
was not widely adopted. Instead, multicast is implemented in exactly the
same way as broadcast.</p>

<div class="section" id="virtual-lans-vlans">
<h2>Virtual LANs (VLANs)<a class="headerlink" href="#virtual-lans-vlans" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>One limitation of switches is that they do not scale. It is not
realistic to connect more than a few switches, where in practice <em>few</em>
typically means “tens of.” One reason for this is that the spanning
tree algorithm scales linearly; that is, there is no provision for
imposing a hierarchy on the set of switches. A second reason is that
switches forward all broadcast frames. While it is reasonable for all
hosts within a limited setting (say, a department) to see each other’s
broadcast messages, it is unlikely that all the hosts in a larger
environment (say, a large company or university) would want to have to
be bothered by each other’s broadcast messages. Said another way,
broadcast does not scale, and as a consequence L2-based networks do
not scale.</p>
<p>One approach to increasing the scalability is the <em>virtual LAN</em> (VLAN).
VLANs allow a single extended LAN to be partitioned into several
seemingly separate LANs. Each virtual LAN is assigned an identifier
(sometimes called a <em>color</em>), and packets can only travel from one
segment to another if both segments have the same identifier. This has
the effect of limiting the number of segments in an extended LAN that
will receive any given broadcast packet.</p>
<div class="figure align-center" id="id6">
<span id="fig-vlan"></span><a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/Slide7.png"><img alt="../_images/Slide7.png" src="../_images/Slide7.png" style="width: 350px;" /></a>
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-number">Figure 68. </span><span class="caption-text">Two virtual LANs share a common backbone.</span></p>
</div>
<p>We can see how VLANs work with an example. <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-vlan"><span class="std std-numref">Figure 68</span></a> shows four hosts and two switches. In the absence of
VLANs, any broadcast packet from any host will reach all the other
hosts. Now let’s suppose that we define the segments connected to
hosts W and X as being in one VLAN, which we’ll call VLAN 100. We also
define the segments that connect to hosts&nbsp;Y and Z as being in
VLAN 200. To do this, we need to configure a VLAN ID on each port of
switches&nbsp;S1 and S2. The link between S1 and S2 is considered to be in
both VLANs.</p>
<p>When a packet sent by host X arrives at switch S2, the switch observes
that it came in a port that was configured as being in VLAN 100. It
inserts a VLAN header between the Ethernet header and its payload. The
interesting part of the VLAN header is the VLAN ID; in this case, that
ID is set to 100. The switch now applies its normal rules for forwarding
to the packet, with the extra restriction that the packet may not be
sent out an interface that is not part of VLAN 100. Thus, under no
circumstances will the packet—even a broadcast packet—be sent out the
interface to host&nbsp;Z, which is in VLAN 200. The packet, however, is
forwarded on to switch&nbsp;S1, which follows the same rules and thus may
forward the packet to host&nbsp;W but not to host&nbsp;Y.</p>
<p>An attractive feature of VLANs is that it is possible to change the
logical topology without moving any wires or changing any addresses. For
example, if we wanted to make the link that connects to host&nbsp;Z be part
of VLAN 100 and thus enable X, W, and Z to be on the same virtual LAN,
then we would just need to change one piece of configuration on switch
S2.</p>
<p>Supporting VLANs requires a fairly simple extension to the
original 802.1 header specification, inserting a 12-bit VLAN ID
(<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">VID</span></code>) field between the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">SrcAddr</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Type</span></code> fields, as shown in
<a class="reference internal" href="#fig-vlan-tag"><span class="std std-numref">Figure 69</span></a>. (This VID is typically referred to as
a <em>VLAN Tag</em>.) There are actually 32-bits inserted in the middle of
the header, but the first 16-bits are used to preserve backwards
compatibility with the original specification (they use <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Type</span> <span class="pre">=</span>
<span class="pre">0x8100</span></code> to indicate that this frame includes the VLAN extension); the
other four bits hold control information used to prioritize
frames. This means it is possible to map <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(2^{12} = 4096\)</span> virtual
networks onto a single physical LAN.</p>

</div>
<p>We conclude this discussion by observing there is another limitation
of networks built by interconnecting L2 switches: lack of support for
heterogeneity. That is, switches are limited in the kinds of networks
they can interconnect. In particular, switches make use of the
network’s frame header and so can support only networks that have
exactly the same format for addresses. For example, switches can be
used to connect Ethernet and 802.11-based networks to each other, since
they share a common header format, but switches do not readily
generalize to other kinds of networks with different addressing
formats, such as ATM, SONET, PON, or the cellular network. The next
section explains how to address this limitation, as well as to scale
switched networks to even larger sizes.</p>
