<h1>3.5 Implementation<a class="headerlink" href="#implementation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>So far, we have talked about what switches and routers must do without
describing how they do it. There is a straightforward way to build a
switch or router: Buy a general-purpose processor and equip it with
multiple network interfaces. Such a device, running suitable software,
can receive packets on one of its interfaces, perform any of the
switching or forwarding functions described in this chapter, and send
packets out another of its interfaces. This so called <em>software
switch</em> is not too far removed from the architecture of many
commercial mid- to low-end network devices.<a class="footnote-reference" href="#id2" id="id1">[1]</a> Implementations that
deliver high-end performance typically take advantage of additional
hardware acceleration. We refer to these as <em>hardware switches</em>,
although both approaches obviously include a combination of hardware
and software.</p>

</table>
<p>This section gives an overview of both software-centric and
hardware-centric designs, but it is worth noting that on the question of
switches versus routers, the distinction isn’t such a big deal. It turns
out that the implementation of switches and routers have so much in
common that a network administrator typically buys a single forwarding
box and then configures it to be an L2 switch, an L3 router, or some
combination of the two. Since their internal designs are so similar,
we’ll use the word <em>switch</em> to cover both variants throughout this
section, avoiding the tedium of saying “switch or router” all the time.
We’ll call out the differences between the two when appropriate.</p>
<div class="section" id="software-switch">
<h2>Software Switch<a class="headerlink" href="#software-switch" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="#fig-softswitch"><span class="std std-numref">Figure 93</span></a> shows a software switch built
using a general-purpose processor with four network interface cards
(NICs). The path for a typical packet that arrives on, say, NIC 1 and
is forwarded out on NIC 2 is straightforward: as NIC 1 receives the
packet it copies its bytes directly into the main memory over the I/O
bus (PCIe in this example) using a technique called <em>direct memory
access</em> (DMA). Once the packet is in memory, the CPU examines its
header to determine which interface the packet should be sent out on,
and instructs NIC 2 to transmit the packet, again directly out of main
memory using DMA. The important take-away is that the packet is
buffered in main memory (this is the “store” half of
store-and-forward), with the CPU reading only the necessary header
fields into its internal registers for processing.</p>
<div class="figure align-center" id="id5">
<span id="fig-softswitch"></span><a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/Slide14.png"><img alt="../_images/Slide14.png" src="../_images/Slide14.png" style="width: 300px;" /></a>
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-number">Figure 93. </span><span class="caption-text">A general-purpose processor used as a software
switch.</span></p>
</div>
<p>There are two potential bottlenecks with this approach, one or both of
which limits the aggregate packet forwarding capacity of the software
switch.</p>
<p>The first problem is that performance is limited by the fact that all
packets must pass into and out of main memory. Your mileage will vary
based on how much you are willing to pay for hardware, but as an
example, a machine limited by a 1333-MHz, 64-bit-wide memory bus can
transmit data at a peak rate of a little over 100&nbsp;Gbps—enough to build a
switch with a handful of 10-Gbps Ethernet ports, but hardly enough for a
high-end router in the core of the Internet.</p>
<p>Moreover, this upper bound assumes that moving data is the only problem.
This is a fair approximation for long packets but a bad one when packets
are short, which is the worst-case situation switch designers have to
plan for. With minimum-sized packets, the cost of processing each
packet—parsing its header and deciding which output link to transmit it
on—is likely to dominate, and potentially become a bottleneck. Suppose,
for example, that a processor can perform all the necessary processing
to switch 40 million packets each second. This is sometimes called the
packet per second (pps) rate. If the average packet is 64&nbsp;bytes, this
would imply</p>
<p class="centered">
<strong>Throughput = pps x BitsPerPacket</strong></p><p class="centered">
<strong>= 40 × 10<sup>6</sup> × 64 × 8</strong></p><p class="centered">
<strong>= 2048 × 10<sup>7</sup></strong></p><p>that is, a throughput of about 20 Gbps—fast, but substantially below the
range users are demanding from their switches today. Bear in mind that
this 20 Gbps would be shared by all users connected to the switch, just
as the bandwidth of a single (unswitched) Ethernet segment is shared
among all users connected to the shared medium. Thus, for example, a
16-port switch with this aggregate throughput would only be able to cope
with an average data rate of about 1 Gbps on each port.<a class="footnote-reference" href="#id4" id="id3">[2]</a></p>

maximum throughput rate that highly tuned software running on a
high-end server could achieve, but they are indicative of
limits one ultimately faces in pursuing this approach.</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>One final consideration is important to understand when evaluating
switch implementations. The non-trivial algorithms discussed in this
chapter—the spanning tree algorithm used by learning bridges, the
distance-vector algorithm used by RIP, and the link-state algorithm used
by OSPF—are <em>not</em> directly part of the per-packet forwarding decision.
They run periodically in the background, but switches do not have to
execute, say, OSPF code for every packet it forwards. The most costly
routine the CPU is likely to execute on a per-packet basis is a table
lookup, for example, looking up a VCI number in a VC table, an IP
address in an L3 forwarding table, or an Ethernet address in an L2
forwarding table.</p>
<div class="admonition-key-takeaway admonition" id="key-control-data">
<p class="first admonition-title">Key Takeaway</p>
<p>The distinction between these two kinds of processing is important
enough to give it a name: the <em>control plane</em> corresponds to the
background processing required to “control” the network (e.g.,
running OSPF, RIP, or the BGP protocol described in the next chapter)
and the <em>data plane</em> corresponds to the per-packet processing
required to move packets from input port to output port. For
historical reasons, this distinction is called <em>control plane</em> and
<em>user plane</em> in cellular access networks, but the idea is the same,
and in fact, the 3GPP standard defines CUPS (Control/User Plane
Separation) as an architectural principle.</p>
<p class="last">These two kinds of processing are easy to conflate when both run on
the same CPU, as is the case in software switch depicted in <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-softswitch"><span class="std std-numref">Figure
93</span></a>, but performance can be dramatically improved by
optimizing how the data plane is implemented, and correspondingly,
specifying a well-defined interface between the control and data
planes. <a class="reference internal" href="#key-sdn"><span class="std std-ref">[Next]</span></a></p>

<h2>Hardware Switch<a class="headerlink" href="#hardware-switch" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Throughout much of the Internet’s history, high-performance switches and
routers have been specialized devices, built with Application-Specific
Integrated Circuits (ASICs). While it was possible to build low-end
routers and switches using commodity servers running C programs, ASICs
were required to achieve the required throughput rates.</p>
<p>The problem with ASICs is that hardware takes a long time to design and
fabricate, meaning the delay for adding new features to a switch is
usually measured in years, not the days or weeks today’s software
industry is accustomed to. Ideally, we’d like to benefit from the
performance of ASICs and the agility of software.</p>
<p>Fortunately, recent advances in domain specific processors (and other
commodity components) have made this possible. Just as importantly, the
full architectural specification for switches that take advantage of
these new processors is now available on-line—the hardware equivalent of
<em>open source software</em>. This means anyone can build a high-performance
switch by pulling the blueprint off the web (see the Open Compute
Project, OCP, for examples) in the same way it is possible to build your
own PC. In both cases you still need software to run on the hardware,
but just as Linux is available to run on your home-built PC, there are
now open source L2 and L3 stacks available on GitHub to run on your
home-built switch. Alternatively, you can simply buy a pre-built switch
from a commodity switch manufacturer and then load your own software
onto it. The following describes these open <em>white-box switches</em>, so
called to contrast them with closed “black-box” devices that have
historically dominated the industry.</p>
<div class="figure align-center" id="id6">
<span id="fig-whitebox"></span><a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/Slide22.png"><img alt="../_images/Slide22.png" src="../_images/Slide22.png" style="width: 500px;" /></a>
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-number">Figure 94. </span><span class="caption-text">White-box switch using a Network Processing
Unit.</span></p>
</div>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="#fig-whitebox"><span class="std std-numref">Figure 94</span></a> is a simplified depiction of a
white-box switch. The key difference from the earlier implementation
on a general-purpose processor is the addition of a Network Processor
Unit (NPU), a domain-specific processor with an architecture and
instruction set that has been optimized for processing packet headers
(i.e., for implementing the data plane). NPUs are similar in spirit to
GPUs that have an architecture optimized for rendering computer
graphics, but in this case, the NPU is optimized for parsing packet
headers and making a forwarding decision. NPUs are able to process
packets (input, make a forwarding decision, and output) at rates
measured in Terabits-per-second (Tbps), easily fast enough to keep up
with 32x100-Gbps ports, or the 48x40-Gbps ports shown in the diagram.</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="first sidebar-title">Network Processing Units</p>
<p class="last">Our use of the term NPU is a bit
non-standard. Historically, NPU was the name given more
narrowly-defined network processing chips used, for
example, to implement intelligent firewalls or deep
packet inspection. They were not as general-purpose as
the NPUs we’re discussing here; nor were they as
high-performance. It seems likely that the current
approach will make purpose-built network processors
obsolete, but in any case, we prefer the NPU nomenclator
because it is consistent with the trend to build
programmable domain-specific processors, including GPUs
for graphics and TPUs (Tensor Processing Units) for AI.</p>
</div>
<p>The beauty of this new switch design is that a given white-box can now
be programmed to be an L2 switch, and L3 router, or a combination of
both, just by a matter of programming. The exact same control plane
software stack used in a software switch still runs on the control CPU,
but in addition, data plane “programs” are loaded onto the NPU to
reflect the forwarding decisions made by the control plane software.
Exactly how one “programs” the NPU depends on the chip vendor, of which
there are currently several. In some cases, the forwarding pipeline is
fixed and the control processor merely loads the forwarding table into
the NPU (by fixed we mean the NPU only knows how to process certain
headers, like Ethernet and IP), but in other cases, the forwarding
pipeline is itself programmable. P4 is a new programming language that
can be used to program such NPU-based forwarding pipelines. Among other
things, P4 tries to hide many of the differences in the underlying NPU
instruction sets.</p>
<p>Internally, an NPU takes advantage of three technologies. First, a fast
SRAM-based memory buffers packets while they are being processed. SRAM
(Static Random Access Memory), is roughly an order of magnitude faster
than the DRAM (Dynamic Random Access Memory) that is used by main
memory. Second, a TCAM-based memory stores bit patterns to be matched in
the packets being processed. The “CAM” in TCAM stands for “Content
Addressable Memory,” which means that the key you want to look up in a
table can effectively be used as the address into the memory that
implements the table. The “T” stands for “Ternary” which is a fancy way
to say the key you want to look up can have wildcards in it (e.g, key
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">10*1</span></code> matches both <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">1001</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">1011</span></code>). Finally, the processing
involved to forward each packet is implemented by a forwarding pipeline.
This pipeline is implemented by an ASIC, but when well-designed, the
pipeline’s forwarding behavior can be modified by changing the program
it runs. At a high level, this program is expressed as a collection of
<em>(Match, Action)</em> pairs: if you match such-and-such field in the header,
then execute this-or-that action.</p>
<p>The relevance of packet processing being implemented by a multi-stage
pipeline rather than a single-stage processor is that forwarding a
single packet likely involves looking at multiple header fields. Each
stage can be programmed to look at a different combination of fields. A
multi-stage pipeline adds a little end-to-end latency to each packet
(measured in nanoseconds), but also means that multiple packets can be
processed at the same time. For example, Stage 2 can be making a second
lookup on packet A while Stage 1 is doing an initial lookup on packet B,
and so on. This means the NPU as a whole is able to keep up with line
speeds. As of this writing, the state-of-the-art is 12.8 Tbps.</p>
<p>Finally, <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-whitebox"><span class="std std-numref">Figure 94</span></a> includes other commodity
components that make this all practical. In particular, it is now
possible to buy pluggable <em>transceiver</em> modules that take care of all
the media access details—be it Gigabit Ethernet, 10-Gigabit Ethernet,
or SONET—as well as the optics. These transceivers all conform to
standardized form factors, such as SFP+, that can in turn be connected
to other components over a standardized bus (e.g., SFI). Again, the
key takeaway is that the networking industry is just now entering into
the same commoditized world that the computing industry has enjoyed
for the last two decades.</p>

<div class="section" id="software-defined-networks">
<h2>Software Defined Networks<a class="headerlink" href="#software-defined-networks" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>With switches becoming increasingly commoditized, attention is
rightfully shifting to the software that controls them. This puts us
squarely in the middle of a trend to build <em>Software Defined Networks</em>
(SDN), an idea that started to germinate about ten years ago. In fact,
it was the early stages of SDN that triggered the networking industry to
move towards white-box switches.</p>
<p>The fundamental idea of SDN is one we’ve already discussed: to
decouple the network control plane (i.e., where routing algorithms
like RIP, OSPF, and BGP run) from the network data plane (i.e., where
packet forwarding decisions get made), with the former moved into
software running on commodity servers and the latter implemented by
white-box switches. The key enabling idea behind SDN was to take this
decoupling a step further, and to define a standard interface between
the control plane and the data plane. Doing so allows any
implementation of the control plane to talk to any implementation of
the data plane; this breaks the dependency on any one vendor’s bundled
solution. The original interface is called <em>OpenFlow</em>, and this idea
of decoupling the control and data planes came to be known as
disaggregation. (The P4 language mentioned in the previous subsection
is a second-generation attempt to define this interface by
generalizing OpenFlow.)</p>
<p>Another important aspect of disaggregation is that a logically
centralized control plane can be used to control a distributed network
data plane. We say logically centralized because while the state
collected by the control plane is maintained in a global data structure,
such as a Network Map, the implementation of this data structure could
still be distributed over multiple servers. For example, it could run in
a cloud. This is important for both scalability and availability, where
the key is that the two planes are configured and scaled independent of
each other. This idea took off quickly in the cloud, where today’s cloud
providers run SDN-based solutions both within their datacenters and
across the backbone networks that interconnect their datacenters.</p>
<p>One consequence of this design that isn’t immediately obvious is that a
logically centralized control plane doesn’t just manage a network of
physical (hardware) switches that interconnects physical servers, but it
also manages a network of virtual (software) switches that interconnect
virtual servers (e.g., Virtual Machines and containers). If you’re
counting “switch ports” (a good measure of all the devices connected to
your network) then the number of virtual ports in the Internet rocketed
past the number of physical ports in 2012.</p>

</div>
<p>One of other key enablers for SDN’s success, as depicted in
<a class="reference internal" href="#fig-sdn"><span class="std std-numref">Figure 95</span></a>, is the Network Operating System
(NOS). Like a server operating system (e.g., Linux, iOS, Android,
Windows) that provides a set of high-level abstractions that make it
easier to implement applications (e.g., you can read and write files
instead of directly accessing disk drives), a NOS makes it easier to
implement network control functionality, otherwise known as <em>Control
Apps</em>. A good NOS abstracts the details of the network switches and
provides a <em>Network Map</em> abstraction to the application developer. The
NOS detects changes in the underlying network (e.g., switches, ports,
and links going up-and-down) and the control application simply
implements the behavior it wants on this abstract graph. This means
the NOS takes on the burden of collecting network state (the hard part
of distributed algorithms like Link-State and Distance-Vector
algorithms) and the app is free to simply implement the shortest path
algorithm and load the forwarding rules into the underlying
switches. By centralizing this logic, the goal is to come up with a
globally optimized solution. The published evidence from cloud
providers that have embraced this approach confirms this advantage.</p>
<div class="admonition-key-takeaway admonition" id="key-sdn">
<p class="first admonition-title">Key Takeaway</p>
<p class="last">It is important to understand that SDN is an implementation
strategy. It does not magically make fundamental problems like
needing to compute a forwarding table go away. But instead of
burdening the switches with having to exchange messages with each
other as part of a distributed routing algorithm, the logically
centralized SDN controller is charged with collecting link and port
status information from the individual switches, constructing a
global view of the network graph, and making that graph available
to the control apps.  From the control application’s perspective,
all the information it needs to compute the forwarding table is
locally available.  Keeping in mind that the SDN Controller is
logically centralized but physically replicated on multple
servers—for both scalable performance and high availability—it is
still a hotly contested question whether the centralized or
distributed approach is best. <a class="reference internal" href="../scaling/global.html#key-tradeoffs"><span class="std std-ref">[Next]</span></a></p>

<p>As much of an advantage as the cloud providers have been able to get out
of SDN, its adoption in enterprises and Telcos has been much slower.
This is partly about the ability of different markets to manage their
networks. The Googles, Microsofts, and Amazons of the world have the
engineers and DevOps skills needed to take advantage of this technology,
whereas others still prefer pre-packaged and integrated solutions that
support the management and command line interfaces they are familiar
