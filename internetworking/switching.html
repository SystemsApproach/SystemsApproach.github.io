<h1>3.1 Switching Basics<a class="headerlink" href="#switching-basics" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>In the simplest terms, a switch is a mechanism that allows us to
interconnect links to form a larger network. A switch is a multi-input,
multi-output device that transfers packets from an input to one or more
outputs. Thus, a switch adds the star topology (see
<a class="reference internal" href="#fig-star"><span class="std std-numref">Figure 56</span></a>) to the set of possible network
structures. A star topology has several attractive properties:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Even though a switch has a fixed number of inputs and outputs, which
limits the number of hosts that can be connected to a single switch,
large networks can be built by interconnecting a number of switches.</li>
<li>We can connect switches to each other and to hosts using
point-to-point links, which typically means that we can build
networks of large geographic scope.</li>
<li>Adding a new host to the network by connecting it to a switch does
not necessarily reduce the performance of the network for other hosts
already connected.</li>
</ul>

<p class="caption"><span class="caption-number">Figure 56. </span><span class="caption-text">A switch provides a star topology.</span></p>
</div>
<p>This last claim cannot be made for the shared-media networks discussed
in the last chapter. For example, it is impossible for two hosts on the
same 10-Mbps Ethernet segment to transmit continuously at 10&nbsp;Mbps
because they share the same transmission medium. Every host on a
switched network has its own link to the switch, so it may be entirely
possible for many hosts to transmit at the full link speed (bandwidth),
provided that the switch is designed with enough aggregate capacity.
Providing high aggregate throughput is one of the design goals for a
switch; we return to this topic later. In general, switched networks are
considered more <em>scalable</em> (i.e., more capable of growing to large
numbers of nodes) than shared-media networks because of this ability to
support many hosts at full speed.</p>
<p>A switch is connected to a set of links and, for each of these links,
runs the appropriate data link protocol to communicate with the node at
the other end of the link. A switch’s primary job is to receive incoming
packets on one of its links and to transmit them on some other link.
This function is sometimes referred to as either <em>switching</em> or
<em>forwarding,</em> and in terms of the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI)
architecture, it is the main function of the network layer, otherwise
known as <em>Layer 2</em>.</p>
<p>The question, then, is how does the switch decide which output link to
place each packet on? The general answer is that it looks at the header
of the packet for an identifier that it uses to make the decision. The
details of how it uses this identifier vary, but there are two common
approaches. The first is the <em>datagram</em> or <em>connectionless</em> approach.
The second is the <em>virtual circuit</em> or <em>connection-oriented</em> approach. A
third approach, <em>source routing</em>, is less common than these other two,
but it does have some useful applications.</p>
<p>One thing that is common to all networks is that we need to have a way
to identify the end nodes. Such identifiers are usually called
<em>addresses</em>. We have already seen examples of addresses, such as the
48-bit address used for Ethernet. The only requirement for Ethernet
addresses is that no two nodes on a network have the same address. This
is accomplished by making sure that all Ethernet cards are assigned a
<em>globally unique</em> identifier. For the following discussion, we assume
that each host has a globally unique address. Later on, we consider
other useful properties that an address might have, but global
uniqueness is adequate to get us started.</p>
<p>Another assumption that we need to make is that there is some way to
identify the input and output ports of each switch. There are at least
two sensible ways to identify ports: One is to number each port, and the
other is to identify the port by the name of the node (switch or host)
to which it leads. For now, we use numbering of the ports.</p>
<div class="section" id="datagrams">
<h2>Datagrams<a class="headerlink" href="#datagrams" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The idea behind datagrams is incredibly simple: You just include in
every packet enough information to enable any switch to decide how to
get it to its destination. That is, every packet contains the complete
destination address. Consider the example network illustrated in
<a class="reference internal" href="#fig-dgram"><span class="std std-numref">Figure 57</span></a>, in which the hosts have addresses A,
B, C, and so on. To decide how to forward a packet, a switch consults
a <em>forwarding table</em> (sometimes called a <em>routing table</em>), an example
of which is depicted in <a class="reference internal" href="#tab-fwdtab"><span class="std std-numref">Table 5</span></a>. This
particular table shows the forwarding information that switch&nbsp;2 needs
to forward datagrams in the example network. It is pretty easy to
figure out such a table when you have a complete map of a simple
network like that depicted here; we could imagine a network operator
configuring the tables statically. It is a lot harder to create the
forwarding tables in large, complex networks with dynamically changing
topologies and multiple paths between destinations. That harder
problem is known as <em>routing</em> and is the topic of a later section. We
can think of routing as a process that takes place in the background
so that, when a data packet turns up, we will have the right
information in the forwarding table to be able to forward, or switch,
the packet.</p>

<p>Datagram networks have the following characteristics:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>A host can send a packet anywhere at any time, since any packet that
turns up at a switch can be immediately forwarded (assuming a
correctly populated forwarding table). For this reason, datagram
networks are often called <em>connectionless</em>; this contrasts with the
<em>connection-oriented</em> networks described below, in which some
<em>connection state</em> needs to be established before the first data
packet is sent.</li>
<li>When a host sends a packet, it has no way of knowing if the network
is capable of delivering it or if the destination host is even up and
running.</li>
<li>Each packet is forwarded independently of previous packets that might
have been sent to the same destination. Thus, two successive packets
from host&nbsp;A to host&nbsp;B may follow completely different paths (perhaps
because of a change in the forwarding table at some switch in the
network).</li>
<li>A switch or link failure might not have any serious effect on
communication if it is possible to find an alternate route around the
failure and to update the forwarding table accordingly.</li>
</ul>
<p>This last fact is particularly important to the history of datagram
networks. One of the important design goals of the Internet is
robustness to failures, and history has shown it to be quite effective
at meeting this goal. Since datagram-based networks are the dominant
technology discussed in this book, we postpone illustrative examples
for the following sections, and move on to the two main alternatives.</p>

<div class="section" id="virtual-circuit-switching">
<h2>Virtual Circuit Switching<a class="headerlink" href="#virtual-circuit-switching" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>A second technique for packet switching uses the concept of a <em>virtual
circuit</em> (VC). This approach, which is also referred to as a
<em>connection-oriented model</em>, requires setting up a virtual connection
from the source host to the destination host before any data is
sent. To understand how this works, consider <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-vcircuit"><span class="std std-numref">Figure 58</span></a>, where host&nbsp;A again wants to send packets to
host&nbsp;B. We can think of this as a two-stage process. The first stage
is “connection setup.” The second is data transfer. We consider each
in turn.</p>
<div class="figure align-center" id="id4">
<span id="fig-vcircuit"></span><a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/f03-03-9780123850591.png"><img alt="../_images/f03-03-9780123850591.png" src="../_images/f03-03-9780123850591.png" style="width: 500px;" /></a>
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-number">Figure 58. </span><span class="caption-text">An example of a virtual circuit network.</span></p>
</div>
<p>In the connection setup phase, it is necessary to establish a
“connection state” in each of the switches between the source and
destination hosts. The connection state for a single connection consists
of an entry in a “VC table” in each switch through which the connection
passes. One entry in the VC table on a single switch contains:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>A <em>virtual circuit identifier</em> (VCI) that uniquely identifies the
connection at this switch and which will be carried inside the header
of the packets that belong to this connection</li>
<li>An incoming interface on which packets for this VC arrive at the
switch</li>
<li>An outgoing interface in which packets for this VC leave the switch</li>
<li>A potentially different VCI that will be used for outgoing packets</li>
</ul>
<p>The semantics of one such entry is as follows: If a packet arrives on
the designated incoming interface and that packet contains the
designated VCI value in its header, then that packet should be sent out
the specified outgoing interface with the specified outgoing VCI value
having been first placed in its header.</p>
<p>Note that the combination of the VCI of packets as they are received at
the switch <em>and</em> the interface on which they are received uniquely
identifies the virtual connection. There may of course be many virtual
connections established in the switch at one time. Also, we observe that
the incoming and outgoing VCI values are generally not the same. Thus,
the VCI is not a globally significant identifier for the connection;
rather, it has significance only on a given link (i.e., it has
<em>link-local scope</em>).</p>
<p>Whenever a new connection is created, we need to assign a new VCI for
that connection on each link that the connection will traverse. We also
need to ensure that the chosen VCI on a given link is not currently in
use on that link by some existing connection.</p>
<p>There are two broad approaches to establishing connection state. One is
to have a network administrator configure the state, in which case the
virtual circuit is “permanent.” Of course, it can also be deleted by the
administrator, so a permanent virtual circuit (PVC) might best be
thought of as a long-lived or administratively configured VC.
Alternatively, a host can send messages into the network to cause the
state to be established. This is referred to as <em>signalling</em>, and the
resulting virtual circuits are said to be <em>switched</em>. The salient
characteristic of a switched virtual circuit (SVC) is that a host may
set up and delete such a VC dynamically without the involvement of a
network administrator. Note that an SVC should more accurately be called
a <em>signalled</em> VC, since it is the use of signalling (not switching) that
distinguishes an SVC from a&nbsp;PVC.</p>
<p>Let’s assume that a network administrator wants to manually create a
new virtual connection from host&nbsp;A to host&nbsp;B. First, the administrator
needs to identify a path through the network from A to B. In the
example network of <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-vcircuit"><span class="std std-numref">Figure 58</span></a>, there is only
one such path, but in general, this may not be the case. The
administrator then picks a VCI value that is currently unused on each
link for the connection. For the purposes of our example, let’s
suppose that the VCI value 5 is chosen for the link from host&nbsp;A to
switch&nbsp;1, and that 11 is chosen for the link from switch&nbsp;1 to
switch&nbsp;2. In that case, switch&nbsp;1 needs to have an entry in its VC
table configured as shown in <a class="reference internal" href="#tab-vctab"><span class="std std-numref">Table 6</span></a>.</p>

<p>Similarly, suppose that the VCI of 7 is chosen to identify this
connection on the link from switch&nbsp;2 to switch&nbsp;3 and that a VCI of 4 is
chosen for the link from switch&nbsp;3 to host&nbsp;B. In that case, switches 2
and 3 need to be configured with VC table entries as shown in
<a class="reference internal" href="#tab-vctab2"><span class="std std-numref">Table 7</span></a> and  <a class="reference internal" href="#tab-vctab3"><span class="std std-numref">Table 8</span></a>,
respectively. Note that the “outgoing” VCI value at one switch is the

<p class="caption"><span class="caption-number">Figure 59. </span><span class="caption-text">A packet is sent into a virtual circuit network.</span></p>
</div>
<p>Once the VC tables have been set up, the data transfer phase can
proceed, as illustrated in <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-vcdat"><span class="std std-numref">Figure 59</span></a>. For any
packet that it wants to send to host&nbsp;B, A puts the VCI value of 5 in
the header of the packet and sends it to switch&nbsp;1. Switch&nbsp;1 receives
any such packet on interface&nbsp;2, and it uses the combination of the
interface and the VCI in the packet header to find the appropriate VC
table entry. As shown in <a class="reference internal" href="#tab-vctab"><span class="std std-numref">Table 6</span></a>, the table
entry in this case tells switch&nbsp;1 to forward the packet out of
interface 1 and to put the VCI value 11 in the header when the packet
is sent. Thus, the packet will arrive at switch&nbsp;2 on interface 3
bearing VCI 11. Switch&nbsp;2 looks up interface 3 and VCI 11 in its VC
table (as shown in <a class="reference internal" href="#tab-vctab2"><span class="std std-numref">Table 7</span></a>) and sends the
packet on to switch &nbsp;3 after updating the VCI value in the packet
header appropriately, as shown in <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-vcdat2"><span class="std std-numref">Figure 60</span></a>. This process continues until it arrives at host&nbsp;B with
the VCI value of 4 in the packet. To host&nbsp;B, this identifies the
packet as having come from host&nbsp;A.</p>
<p>In real networks of reasonable size, the burden of configuring VC tables
correctly in a large number of switches would quickly become excessive
using the above procedures. Thus, either a network management tool or
some sort of signalling (or both) is almost always used, even when
setting up “permanent” VCs. In the case of PVCs, signalling is initiated
by the network administrator, while SVCs are usually set up using
signalling by one of the hosts. We consider now how the same VC just
described could be set up by signalling from the host.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="caption-number">Figure 60. </span><span class="caption-text">A packet makes its way through a virtual circuit
network.</span></p>
</div>
<p>To start the signalling process, host&nbsp;A sends a setup message into the
network—that is, to switch&nbsp;1. The setup message contains, among other
things, the complete destination address of host&nbsp;B. The setup message
needs to get all the way to B to create the necessary connection state
in every switch along the way. We can see that getting the setup message
to B is a lot like getting a datagram to B, in that the switches have to
know which output to send the setup message to so that it eventually
reaches B. For now, let’s just assume that the switches know enough
about the network topology to figure out how to do that, so that the
setup message flows on to switches 2 and 3 before finally reaching
host&nbsp;B.</p>
<p>When switch&nbsp;1 receives the connection request, in addition to sending
it on to switch&nbsp;2, it creates a new entry in its virtual circuit table
for this new connection. This entry is exactly the same as shown
previously in <a class="reference internal" href="#tab-vctab"><span class="std std-numref">Table 6</span></a>. The main difference is
that now the task of assigning an unused VCI value on the interface is
performed by the switch for that port. In this example, the switch
picks the value 5. The virtual circuit table now has the following
information: “When packets arrive on port&nbsp;2 with identifier&nbsp;5, send
them out on port&nbsp;1.” Another issue is that, somehow, host&nbsp;A will need
to learn that it should put the VCI value of 5 in packets that it
wants to send to B; we will see how that happens below.</p>
<p>When switch&nbsp;2 receives the setup message, it performs a similar process;
in this example, it picks the value 11 as the incoming VCI value.
Similarly, switch&nbsp;3 picks 7 as the value for its incoming VCI. Each
switch can pick any number it likes, as long as that number is not
currently in use for some other connection on that port of that switch.
As noted above, VCIs have link-local scope; that is, they have no global
significance.</p>
<p>Finally, the setup message arrives as host&nbsp;B. Assuming that B is healthy
and willing to accept a connection from host&nbsp;A, it too allocates an
incoming VCI value, in this case 4. This VCI value can be used by B to
identify all packets coming from host&nbsp;A.</p>
<p>Now, to complete the connection, everyone needs to be told what their
downstream neighbor is using as the VCI for this connection. Host&nbsp;B
sends an acknowledgment of the connection setup to switch&nbsp;3 and includes
in that message the VCI that it chose&nbsp;(4). Now switch&nbsp;3 can complete the
virtual circuit table entry for this connection, since it knows the
outgoing value must be&nbsp;4. Switch&nbsp;3 sends the acknowledgment on to
switch&nbsp;2, specifying a VCI of&nbsp;7. Switch&nbsp;2 sends the message on to
switch&nbsp;1, specifying a VCI of&nbsp;11. Finally, switch&nbsp;1 passes the
acknowledgment on to host&nbsp;A, telling it to use the VCI of&nbsp;5 for this
connection.</p>
<p>At this point, everyone knows all that is necessary to allow traffic to
flow from host&nbsp;A to host&nbsp;B. Each switch has a complete virtual circuit
table entry for the connection. Furthermore, host&nbsp;A has a firm
acknowledgment that everything is in place all the way to host&nbsp;B. At
this point, the connection table entries are in place in all three
switches just as in the administratively configured example above, but
the whole process happened automatically in response to the signalling
message sent from A. The data transfer phase can now begin and is
identical to that used in the PVC case.</p>
<p>When host&nbsp;A no longer wants to send data to host&nbsp;B, it tears down the
connection by sending a teardown message to switch&nbsp;1. The switch removes
the relevant entry from its table and forwards the message on to the
other switches in the path, which similarly delete the appropriate table
entries. At this point, if host&nbsp;A were to send a packet with a VCI of 5
to switch&nbsp;1, it would be dropped as if the connection had never existed.</p>
<p>There are several things to note about virtual circuit switching:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Since host&nbsp;A has to wait for the connection request to reach the far
side of the network and return before it can send its first data
packet, there is at least one round-trip time (RTT) of delay before
data is sent.</li>
<li>While the connection request contains the full address for host&nbsp;B
(which might be quite large, being a global identifier on the
network), each data packet contains only a small identifier, which is
only unique on one link. Thus, the per-packet overhead caused by the
header is reduced relative to the datagram model. More importantly,
the lookup is fast because the virtual circuit number can be treated
as an index into a table rather than as a key that has to be looked
up.</li>
<li>If a switch or a link in a connection fails, the connection is broken
and a new one will need to be established. Also, the old one needs to
be torn down to free up table storage space in the switches.</li>
<li>The issue of how a switch decides which link to forward the
connection request on has been glossed over. In essence, this is the
same problem as building up the forwarding table for datagram
forwarding, which requires some sort of <em>routing algorithm</em>. Routing
is described in a later section, and the algorithms described there
are generally applicable to routing setup requests as well as
datagrams.</li>
</ul>
<p>One of the nice aspects of virtual circuits is that by the time the host
gets the go-ahead to send data, it knows quite a lot about the
network—for example, that there really is a route to the receiver and
that the receiver is willing and able to receive data. It is also
possible to allocate resources to the virtual circuit at the time it is
established. For example, X.25 (an early and now largely obsolete
virtual-circuit-based networking technology) employed the following
three-part strategy:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Buffers are allocated to each virtual circuit when the circuit is
initialized.</li>
<li>The sliding window protocol is run between each pair of nodes along
the virtual circuit, and this protocol is augmented with flow control
to keep the sending node from over-running the buffers allocated at
the receiving node.</li>
<li>The circuit is rejected by a given node if not enough buffers are
available at that node when the connection request message is
processed.</li>
</ol>
<p>In doing these three things, each node is ensured of having the buffers
it needs to queue the packets that arrive on that circuit. This basic
strategy is usually called <em>hop-by-hop flow control.</em></p>
<p>By comparison, a datagram network has no connection establishment phase,
and each switch processes each packet independently, making it less
obvious how a datagram network would allocate resources in a meaningful
way. Instead, each arriving packet competes with all other packets for
buffer space. If there are no free buffers, the incoming packet must be
discarded. We observe, however, that even in a datagram-based network a
source host often sends a sequence of packets to the same destination
host. It is possible for each switch to distinguish among the set of
packets it currently has queued, based on the source/destination pair,
and thus for the switch to ensure that the packets belonging to each
source/destination pair are receiving a fair share of the switch’s
buffers.</p>
<p>In the virtual circuit model, we could imagine providing each circuit
with a different <em>quality of service</em> (QoS). In this setting, the term
<em>quality of service</em> is usually taken to mean that the network gives the
user some kind of performance-related guarantee, which in turn implies
that switches set aside the resources they need to meet this guarantee.
For example, the switches along a given virtual circuit might allocate a
percentage of each outgoing link’s bandwidth to that circuit. As another
example, a sequence of switches might ensure that packets belonging to a
particular circuit not be delayed (queued) for more than a certain
amount of time.</p>
<p>There have been a number of successful examples of virtual circuit
technologies over the years, notably X.25, Frame Relay, and Asynchronous
Transfer Mode (ATM). With the success of the Internet’s connectionless
model, however, none of them enjoys great popularity today. One of the
most common applications of virtual circuits for many years was the
construction of <em>virtual private networks</em> (VPNs), a subject discussed
in a later section. Even that application is now mostly supported using
Internet-based technologies today.</p>
<div class="section" id="asynchronous-transfer-mode-atm">
<h3>Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM)<a class="headerlink" href="#asynchronous-transfer-mode-atm" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) is probably the most well-known virtual
circuit-based networking technology, although it is now well past its
peak in terms of deployment. ATM became an important technology in the
1980s and early 1990s for a variety of reasons, not the least of which
is that it was embraced by the telephone industry, which at that point
in time was less active in computer networks (other than as a supplier
of links from which other people built networks). ATM also happened to
be in the right place at the right time, as a high-speed switching
technology that appeared on the scene just when shared media like
Ethernet and token rings were starting to look a bit too slow for many
users of computer networks. In some ways ATM was a competing technology
with Ethernet switching, and it was seen by many as a competitor to IP
as well.</p>
<div class="figure align-center" id="id10">

<p class="caption"><span class="caption-number">Figure 61. </span><span class="caption-text">ATM cell format at the UNI.</span></p>
</div>
<p>The approach ATM takes has some interesting properties, which makes it
worth examining a bit further. The picture of the ATM packet format—more
commonly called an ATM <em>cell</em>—in <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-atmcell"><span class="std std-numref">Figure 61</span></a> will illustrate
the main points. We’ll skip the generic flow control (GFC) bits, which
never saw much use, and start with the 24 bits that are labelled VPI
(virtual path identifier—8 bits) and VCI (virtual circuit identifier—16
bits). If you consider these bits together as a single 24-bit field,
they correspond to the virtual circuit identifier introduced above. The
reason for breaking the field into two parts was to allow for a level of
hierarchy: All the circuits with the same VPI could, in some cases, be
treated as a group (a virtual path) and could all be switched together
looking only at the VPI, simplifying the work of a switch that could
ignore all the VCI bits and reducing the size of the VC table
considerably.</p>
<p>Skipping to the last header byte we find an 8-bit cyclic redundancy
check (CRC), known as the <em>header error check</em> (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">HEC</span></code>). It uses CRC-8
and provides error detection and single-bit error correction capability
on the cell header only. Protecting the cell header is particularly
important because an error in the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">VCI</span></code> will cause the cell to be
misdelivered.</p>
<p>Probably the most significant thing to notice about the ATM cell, and
the reason it is called a cell and not a packet, is that it comes in
only one size: 53 bytes. What was the reason for this? One big reason
was to facilitate the implementation of hardware switches. When ATM was
being created in the mid- and late 1980s, 10-Mbps Ethernet was the
cutting-edge technology in terms of speed. To go much faster, most
people thought in terms of hardware. Also, in the telephone world,
people think big when they think of switches—telephone switches often
serve tens of thousands of customers. Fixed-length packets turn out to
be a very helpful thing if you want to build fast, highly scalable
switches. There are two main reasons for this:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>It is easier to build hardware to do simple jobs, and the job of
processing packets is simpler when you already know how long each one
will be.</li>
<li>If all packets are the same length, then you can have lots of
switching elements all doing much the same thing in parallel, each of
them taking the same time to do its job.</li>
</ol>
<p>This second reason, the enabling of parallelism, greatly improves the
scalability of switch designs. It would be overstating the case to say
that fast parallel hardware switches can only be built using
fixed-length cells. However, it is certainly true that cells ease the
task of building such hardware and that there was a lot of knowledge
available about how to build cell switches in hardware at the time the
ATM standards were being defined. As it turns out, this same principle
is still applied in many switches and routers today, even if they deal
in variable length packets—they cut those packets into some sort of cell
in order to forward them from input port to output port, but this is all
internal to the switch.</p>
<p>There is another good argument in favor of small ATM cells, having to do
with end-to-end latency. ATM was designed to carry both voice phone
calls (the dominant use case at the time) and data. Because voice is
low-bandwidth but has strict delay requirements, the last thing you want
is for a small voice packet queued behind a large data packet at a
switch. If you force all packets to be small (i.e., cell-sized), then
large data packets can still be supported by reassembling a set of cells
into a packet, and you get the benefit of being able to interleave the
forwarding of voice cells and data cells at every switch along the path
from source to destination. This idea of using small cells to improve
end-to-end latency is alive and well today in cellular access networks.</p>
<p>Having decided to use small, fixed-length packets, the next question was
what is the right length to fix them at? If you make them too short,
then the amount of header information that needs to be carried around
relative to the amount of data that fits in one cell gets larger, so the
percentage of link bandwidth that is actually used to carry data goes
down. Even more seriously, if you build a device that processes cells at
some maximum number of cells per second, then as cells get shorter the
total data rate drops in direct proportion to cell size. An example of
such a device might be a network adaptor that reassembles cells into
larger units before handing them up to the host. The performance of such
a device depends directly on cell size. On the other hand, if you make
the cells too big, then there is a problem of wasted bandwidth caused by
the need to pad transmitted data to fill a complete cell. If the cell
payload size is 48&nbsp;bytes and you want to send 1&nbsp;byte, you’ll need to
send 47&nbsp;bytes of padding. If this happens a lot, then the utilization of
the link will be very low. The combination of relatively high
header-to-payload ratio plus the frequency of sending partially filled
cells did actually lead to some noticeable inefficiency in ATM networks
that some detractors called the <em>cell tax</em>.</p>
<p>As it turns out, 48 bytes was picked for the ATM cell payload as a
compromise. There were good arguments for both larger and smaller cells,
and 48 made almost no one happy—a power of two would certainly have been
better for computers to process.</p>

<div class="section" id="source-routing">
<h2>Source Routing<a class="headerlink" href="#source-routing" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>A third approach to switching that uses neither virtual circuits nor
conventional datagrams is known as <em>source routing</em>. The name derives
from the fact that all the information about network topology that is
required to switch a packet across the network is provided by the source
host.</p>
<p>There are various ways to implement source routing. One would be to
assign a number to each output of each switch and to place that number
in the header of the packet. The switching function is then very
simple: For each packet that arrives on an input, the switch would
read the port number in the header and transmit the packet on that
output. However, since there will in general be more than one switch
in the path between the sending and the receiving host, the header for
the packet needs to contain enough information to allow every switch
in the path to determine which output the packet needs to be placed
on. One way to do this would be to put an ordered list of switch ports
in the header and to rotate the list so that the next switch in the
path is always at the front of the list. <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-source-route"><span class="std std-numref">Figure 62</span></a> illustrates this idea.</p>
<div class="figure align-center" id="id11">
<span id="fig-source-route"></span><a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/f03-07-9780123850591.png"><img alt="../_images/f03-07-9780123850591.png" src="../_images/f03-07-9780123850591.png" style="width: 500px;" /></a>
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-number">Figure 62. </span><span class="caption-text">Source routing in a switched network (where the switch
reads the rightmost number).</span></p>
</div>
<p>In this example, the packet needs to traverse three switches to get from
host A to host B. At switch 1, it needs to exit on port 1, at the next
switch it needs to exit at port 0, and at the third switch it needs to
exit at port 3. Thus, the original header when the packet leaves host A
contains the list of ports (3, 0, 1), where we assume that each switch
reads the rightmost element of the list. To make sure that the next
switch gets the appropriate information, each switch rotates the list
after it has read its own entry. Thus, the packet header as it leaves
switch 1 enroute to switch 2 is now (1, 3, 0); switch 2 performs another
rotation and sends out a packet with (0, 1, 3) in the header. Although
not shown, switch 3 performs yet another rotation, restoring the header
to what it was when host A sent it.</p>
<p>There are several things to note about this approach. First, it assumes
that host A knows enough about the topology of the network to form a
header that has all the right directions in it for every switch in the
path. This is somewhat analogous to the problem of building the
forwarding tables in a datagram network or figuring out where to send a
setup packet in a virtual circuit network. In practice, however, it is
the first switch at the ingress to the network (as opposed to the end
host connected to that switch) that appends the source route.</p>
<p>Second, observe that we cannot predict how big the header needs to be,
since it must be able to hold one word of information for every switch
on the path. This implies that headers are probably of variable length
with no upper bound, unless we can predict with absolute certainty the
maximum number of switches through which a packet will ever need to
pass.</p>
<p>Third, there are some variations on this approach. For example, rather
than rotate the header, each switch could just strip the first element
as it uses it. Rotation has an advantage over stripping, however: Host B
gets a copy of the complete header, which may help it figure out how to
get back to host A. Yet another alternative is to have the header carry
a pointer to the current “next port” entry, so that each switch just
updates the pointer rather than rotating the header; this may be more
efficient to implement. We show these three approaches in
<a class="reference internal" href="#fig-sroute-apps"><span class="std std-numref">Figure 63</span></a>. In each case, the entry that
this switch needs to read is <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">A</span></code>, and the entry that the next switch
needs to read is <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">B</span></code>.</p>

</div>
<p>Source routing can be used in both datagram networks and virtual circuit
networks. For example, the Internet Protocol, which is a datagram
protocol, includes a source route option that allows selected packets to
be source routed, while the majority are switched as conventional
datagrams. Source routing is also used in some virtual circuit networks
as the means to get the initial setup request along the path from source
to destination.</p>
<p>Source routes are sometimes categorized as <em>strict</em> or <em>loose</em>. In a
strict source route, every node along the path must be specified,
whereas a loose source route only specifies a set of nodes to be
traversed, without saying exactly how to get from one node to the next.
A loose source route can be thought of as a set of waypoints rather than
a completely specified route. The loose option can be helpful to limit
the amount of information that a source must obtain to create a source
route. In any reasonably large network, it is likely to be hard for a
host to get the complete path information it needs to construct correct
a strict source route to any destination. But both types of source
routes do find application in certain scenarios, as we will see in later
chapters.</p>
