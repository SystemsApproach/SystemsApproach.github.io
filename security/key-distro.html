<p>To use ciphers and authenticators, the communicating participants need
to know what keys to use. In the case of a symmetric-key cipher, how
does a pair of participants obtain the key they share? In the case of a
public-key cipher, how do participants know what public key belongs to a
certain participant? The answer differs depending on whether the keys
are short-lived <em>session keys</em> or longer-lived <em>predistributed keys</em>.</p>
<p>A session key is a key used to secure a single, relatively short episode
of communication: a session. Each distinct session between a pair of
participants uses a new session key, which is always a symmetric key for
speed. The participants determine what session key to use by means of a
protocol&#x2014;a session key establishment protocol. A session key
establishment protocol needs its own security (so that, for example, an
adversary cannot learn the new session key); that security is based on
the longer-lived predistributed keys.</p>
<p>There are several motivations for this division of labor between session
keys and predistributed keys:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Limiting the amount of time a key is used results in less time for
 computationally intensive attacks, less ciphertext for
 cryptanalysis, and less information exposed should the key be
 broken.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Predistribution of symmetric keys is problematic.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Public key ciphers are generally superior for authentication and
 session key establishment but too slow to use for encrypting entire
 messages for confidentiality.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This section explains how predistributed keys are distributed, and the
next section will explain how session keys are then established. We
henceforth use &quot;Alice&quot; and &quot;Bob&quot; to designate participants, as is common
in the cryptography literature. Bear in mind that although we tend to
refer to participants in anthropomorphic terms, we are more frequently
concerned with the communication between software or hardware entities
such as clients and servers that often have no direct relationship with

<p>The algorithms to generate a matched pair of public and private keys are
publicly known, and software that does it is widely available. So, if
Alice wanted to use a public-key cipher, she could generate her own pair
of public and private keys, keep the private key hidden, and publicize
the public key. But, how can she publicize her public key&#x2014;assert that
it belongs to her&#x2014;in such a way that other participants can be sure it
really belongs to her? Not via email or Web, because an adversary could
forge an equally plausible claim that key <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math><semantics><mrow><mi>x</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">x</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="strut" style="height:0.43056em;"></span><span class="strut bottom" style="height:0.43056em;vertical-align:0em;"></span><span class="base textstyle uncramped"><span class="mord mathit">x</span></span></span></span> belongs to Alice when

<p>A complete scheme for certifying bindings between public keys and
identities&#x2014;what key belongs to whom&#x2014;is called a <em>Public Key
Infrastructure</em> (PKI). A PKI starts with the ability to verify
identities and bind them to keys out of band. By &quot;out of band,&quot; we mean
something outside the network and the computers that comprise it, such
as in the following If Alice and Bob are individuals who know each
other, then they could get together in the same room and Alice could
give her public key to Bob directly, perhaps on a business card. If Bob
is an organization, Alice the individual could present conventional
identification, perhaps involving a photograph or fingerprints. If Alice
and Bob are computers owned by the same company, then a system
administrator could configure Bob with Alice&apos;s public key.</p>
<p>Establishing keys out of band doesn&apos;t sound like it would scale well,
but it suffices to bootstrap a PKI. Bob&apos;s knowledge that Alice&apos;s key is
<span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math><semantics><mrow><mi>x</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">x</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="strut" style="height:0.43056em;"></span><span class="strut bottom" style="height:0.43056em;vertical-align:0em;"></span><span class="base textstyle uncramped"><span class="mord mathit">x</span></span></span></span> can be widely, scalably disseminated using a combination of digital
signatures and a concept of trust. For example, suppose that you have
received Bob&apos;s public key out of band and that you know enough about Bob
to trust him on matters of keys and identities. Then Bob could send you
a message asserting that Alice&apos;s key is <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math><semantics><mrow><mi>x</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">x</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="strut" style="height:0.43056em;"></span><span class="strut bottom" style="height:0.43056em;vertical-align:0em;"></span><span class="base textstyle uncramped"><span class="mord mathit">x</span></span></span></span> and&#x2014;since you already know
Bob&apos;s public key&#x2014;you could authenticate the message as having come
from Bob. (Remember that to digitally sign the statement Bob would
append a cryptographic hash of it that has been encrypted using his
private key.) Since you trust Bob to tell the truth, you would now know
that Alice&apos;s key is <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math><semantics><mrow><mi>x</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">x</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="strut" style="height:0.43056em;"></span><span class="strut bottom" style="height:0.43056em;vertical-align:0em;"></span><span class="base textstyle uncramped"><span class="mord mathit">x</span></span></span></span>, even though you had never met her or exchanged
a single message with her. Using digital signatures, Bob wouldn&apos;t even
have to send you a message; he could simply create and publish a
digitally signed statement that Alice&apos;s key is <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math><semantics><mrow><mi>x</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">x</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="strut" style="height:0.43056em;"></span><span class="strut bottom" style="height:0.43056em;vertical-align:0em;"></span><span class="base textstyle uncramped"><span class="mord mathit">x</span></span></span></span>. Such a digitally
signed statement of a public key binding is called a <em>public key
certificate</em>, or simply a certificate. Bob could send Alice a copy of
the certificate, or post it on a website. If and when someone needs to
verify Alice&apos;s public key, they could do so by getting a copy of the
certificate, perhaps directly from Alice&#x2014;as long as they trust Bob and
know his public key. You can see how starting from a very small number
of keys (in this case, just Bob&apos;s) you could build up a large set of
trusted keys over time. Bob in this case is playing the role often
referred to as a <em>certification authority</em> (CA), and much of today&apos;s
Internet security depends on CAs. VeriSign is one well-known
commercial CA. We return to this topic below.</p>
<p>One of the major standards for certificates is known as X.509. This
standard leaves a lot of details open, but specifies a basic structure.
A certificate clearly must include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The identity of the entity being certified</p>
</li>
<li><p>The public key of the entity being certified</p>
</li>
<li><p>The identity of the signer</p>
</li>
<li><p>The digital signature</p>
</li>
<li><p>A digital signature algorithm identifier (which cryptographic hash
 and which cipher)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>An optional component is an expiration time for the certificate. We will
see a particular use of this feature below.</p>
<p>Since a certificate creates a binding between an identity and a public
key, we should look more closely at what we mean by &quot;identity.&quot; For
example, a certificate that says, &quot;This public key belongs to John
Smith,&quot; may not be terribly useful if you can&apos;t tell which of the
thousands of John Smiths is being identified. Thus, certificates must
use a well-defined name space for the identities being certified; for
example, certificates are often issued for email addresses and DNS
domains.</p>
<p>There are different ways a PKI could formalize the notion of trust. We
discuss the two main approaches.</p>
<h3 id="certification-authorities">Certification Authorities</h3>
<p>In this model of trust, trust is binary; you either trust someone
completely or not at all. Together with certificates, this allows the
building of <em>chains of trust</em>. If X certifies that a certain public
key belongs to Y, and then Y goes on to certify that another public
key belongs to Z, then there exists a chain of certificates from X
to Z, even though X and Z may have never met. If you know X&apos;s
key&#x2014;and you trust X and Y&#x2014;then you can believe the certificate
that gives Z&apos;s key. In other words, all you need is a chain of
certificates, all signed by entities you trust, as long as it leads back
to an entity whose key you already know.</p>
<p>A <em>certification authority</em> or <em>certificate authority</em> (CA) is an entity
claimed (by someone) to be trustworthy for verifying identities and
issuing public key certificates. There are commercial CAs, governmental
CAs, and even free CAs. To use a CA, you must know its own key. You can
learn that CA&apos;s key, however, if you can obtain a chain of CA-signed
certificates that starts with a CA whose key you already know. Then you
can believe any certificate signed by that new CA.</p>
<p>A common way to build such chains is to arrange them in a
tree-structured hierarchy, as shown in <a href="#pem-tree">Figure 1</a>. If
everyone has the public key of the root CA, then any participant can
provide a chain of certificates to another participant and know that it
will be sufficient to build a chain of trust for that participant.</p>
<figure>
    <a id="pem-tree"></a>
    <img src="figures/f08-06-9780123850591.png" width="600px">
    <figcaption>Tree-structured certification authority hierarchy.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>There are some significant issues with building chains of trust. Most
importantly, even if you are certain that you have the public key of the
root CA, you need to be sure that every CA from the root on down is
doing its job properly. If just one CA in the chain is willing to issue
certificates to entities without verifying their identities, then what
looks like a valid chain of certificates becomes meaningless. For
example, a root CA might issue a certificate to a second-tier CA and
thoroughly verify that the name on the certificate matches the business
name of the CA, but that second-tier CA might be willing to sell
certificates to anyone who asks, without verifying their identity. This
problem gets worse the longer the chain of trust. X.509 certificates
provide the option of restricting the set of entities that the subject
of a certificate is, in turn, trusted to certify.</p>
<p>There can be more than one root to a certification tree, and this is
common in securing Web transactions today, for example. Web browsers
such as Firefox and Internet Explorer come pre-equipped with
certificates for a set of CAs; in effect, the browser&apos;s producer has
decided these CAs and their keys can be trusted. A user can also add CAs
to those that their browser recognizes as trusted. These certificates
are accepted by Secure Socket Layer (SSL)/Transport Layer Security
(TLS), the protocol most often used to secure Web transactions, which we
discuss in a later section. (If you are curious, you can poke around in
the preferences settings for your browser and find the &quot;view
certificates&quot; option to see how many CAs your browser is configured to
trust.)</p>
<h3 id="web-of-trust">Web of Trust</h3>
<p>An alternative model of trust is the <em>web of trust</em> exemplified by
Pretty Good Privacy (PGP), which is further discussed in a later
section. PGP is a security system for email, so email addresses are the
identities to which keys are bound and by which certificates are signed.
In keeping with PGP&apos;s roots as protection against government intrusion,
there are no CAs. Instead, every individual decides whom they trust and
how much they trust them&#x2014;in this model, trust is a matter of degree.
In addition, a public key certificate can include a confidence level
indicating how confident the signer is of the key binding claimed in the
certificate, so a given user may have to have several certificates
attesting to the same key binding before he is willing to trust it.</p>
<p>For example, suppose you have a certificate for Bob provided by Alice;
you can assign a moderate level of trust to that certificate. However,
if you have additional certificates for Bob that were provided by C
and D, each of whom is also moderately trustworthy, that might
considerably increase your level of confidence that the public key you
have for Bob is valid. In short, PGP recognizes that the problem of
establishing trust is quite a personal matter and gives users the raw
material to make their own decisions, rather than assuming that they are
all willing to trust in a single hierarchical structure of CAs. To quote
Phil Zimmerman, the developer of PGP, &quot;PGP is for people who prefer to
pack their own parachutes.&quot;</p>
<p>PGP has become quite popular in the networking community, and PGP
key-signing parties are a regular feature of various networking
events, such as IETF meetings. At these gatherings, an individual can</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Collect public keys from others whose identity he knows.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Provide his public key to others.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Get his public key signed by others, thus collecting certificates
  that will be persuasive to an increasingly large set of people.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Sign the public key of other individuals, thus helping them build up
 their set of certificates that they can use to distribute their
 public keys.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Collect certificates from other individuals whom he trusts enough to
 sign keys.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus, over time, a user will collect a set of certificates with varying
degrees of trust.</p>
<h3 id="certificate-revocation">Certificate Revocation</h3>
<p>One issue that arises with certificates is how to revoke, or undo, a
certificate. Why is this important? Suppose that you suspect that
someone has discovered your private key. There may be any number of
certificates in the universe that assert that you are the owner of the
public key corresponding to that private key. The person who discovered
your private key thus has everything he needs to impersonate you: valid
certificates and your private key. To solve this problem, it would be
nice to be able to revoke the certificates that bind your old,
compromised key to your identity, so that the impersonator will no
longer be able to persuade other people that he is you.</p>
<p>The basic solution to the problem is simple enough. Each CA can issue a
<em>certificate revocation list</em> (CRL), which is a digitally signed list of
certificates that have been revoked. The CRL is periodically updated and
made publicly available. Because it is digitally signed, it can just be
posted on a website. Now, when Alice receives a certificate for Bob that
she wants to verify, she will first consult the latest CRL issued by the
CA. As long as the certificate has not been revoked, it is valid. Note
that, if all certificates have unlimited life spans, the CRL would
always be getting longer, since you could never take a certificate off
the CRL for fear that some copy of the revoked certificate might be
used. For this reason, it is common to attach an expiration date to a
certificate when it is issued. Thus, we can limit the length of time
that a revoked certificate needs to stay on a CRL. As soon as its
original expiration date is passed, it can be removed from the CRL.</p>
<h2 id="predistribution-of-symmetric-keys">Predistribution of Symmetric Keys</h2>
<p>If Alice wants to use a secret-key cipher to communicate with Bob, she
can&apos;t just pick a key and send it to him because, without already
having a key, they can&apos;t encrypt this key to keep it confidential and
they can&apos;t authenticate each other. As with public keys, some
predistribution scheme is needed. Predistribution is harder for
symmetric keys than for public keys for two obvious reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>While only one public key per entity is sufficient for
 authentication and confidentiality, there must be a symmetric key
 for each pair of entities who wish to communicate. If there are N
 entities, that means N(N-1)/2 keys.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Unlike public keys, secret keys must be kept secret.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In summary, there are a lot more keys to distribute, and you can&apos;t use
certificates that everyone can read.</p>
<p>The most common solution is to use a <em>Key Distribution Center</em> (KDC). A
KDC is a trusted entity that shares a secret key with each other entity.
This brings the number of keys down to a more manageable N-1, few
enough to establish out of band for some applications. When Alice wishes
to communicate with Bob, that communication does not travel via the KDC.
Rather, the KDC participates in a protocol that authenticates Alice and
Bob&#x2014;using the keys that the KDC already shares with each of them&#x2014;and
generates a new session key for them to use. Then Alice and Bob
communicate directly using their session key. Kerberos is a widely used
system based on this approach.</p>
