<h1>8.2 Cryptographic Building Blocks<a class="headerlink" href="#cryptographic-building-blocks" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>We introduce the concepts of cryptography-based security step by step.
The first step is the cryptographic algorithms—ciphers and cryptographic
hashes—that are introduced in this section. They are not a solution in
themselves, but rather building blocks from which a solution can be
built. Cryptographic algorithms are parameterized by <em>keys</em>, and a later
section then addresses the problem of distributing the keys. In the next
step, we describe how to incorporate the cryptographic building blocks
into protocols that provide secure communication between participants
who possess the correct keys. A final section then examines several
complete security protocols and systems in current use.</p>
<div class="section" id="principles-of-ciphers">
<h2>Principles of Ciphers<a class="headerlink" href="#principles-of-ciphers" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Encryption transforms a message in such a way that it becomes
unintelligible to any party that does not have the secret of how to
reverse&nbsp;the transformation. The sender applies an <em>encryption</em>
function to the original <em>plaintext</em> message, resulting in a
<em>ciphertext</em> message that is sent over the network, as shown in
<a class="reference internal" href="#fig-genericcrypto"><span class="std std-numref">Figure 195</span></a>. The receiver applies a secret
<em>decryption</em> function—the inverse of the encryption function—to
recover the original plaintext. The ciphertext transmitted across the
network is unintelligible to any eavesdropper, assuming the
eavesdropper doesn’t know the decryption function. The transformation
represented by an encryption function and its corresponding decryption
function is called a <em>cipher</em>.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="caption-number">Figure 195. </span><span class="caption-text">Secret-key encryption and decryption.</span></p>
</div>
<p>Cryptographers have been led to the principle, first stated in 1883,
that encryption and decryption functions should be parameterized by a
<em>key</em>, and furthermore that the functions should be considered public
knowledge—only the key need be secret. Thus, the ciphertext produced for
a given plaintext message depends on both the encryption function and
the key. One reason for this principle is that if you depend on the
cipher being kept secret, then you have to retire the cipher (not just
the keys) when you believe it is no longer secret. This means
potentially frequent changes of cipher, which is problematic since it
takes a lot of work to develop a new cipher. Also, one of the best ways
to know that a cipher is secure is to use it for a long time—if no one
breaks it, it’s probably secure. (Fortunately, there are plenty of
people who will try to break ciphers and who will let it be widely known
when they have succeeded, so no news is generally good news.) Thus,
there is considerable cost and risk in deploying a new cipher. Finally,
parameterizing a cipher with keys provides us with what is in effect a
very large family of ciphers; by switching keys, we essentially switch
ciphers, thereby limiting the amount of data that a <em>cryptanalyst</em>
(code-breaker) can use to try to break our key/cipher and the amount she
can read if she succeeds.</p>
<p>The basic requirement for an encryption algorithm is that it turn
plaintext into ciphertext in such a way that only the intended
recipient—the holder of the decryption key—can recover the plaintext.
What this means is that encrypted messages cannot be read by people who
do not hold the&nbsp;key.</p>
<p>It is important to realize that when a potential attacker receives a
piece of ciphertext, he may have more information at his disposal than
just the ciphertext itself. For example, he may know that the plaintext
was written in English, which means that the letter <em>e</em> occurs more
often in the plaintext that any other letter; the frequency of many
other letters and common letter combinations can also be predicted. This
information can greatly simplify the task of finding the key. Similarly,
he may know something about the likely contents of the message; for
example, the word “login” is likely to occur at the start of a remote
login session. This may enable a <em>known plaintext</em> attack, which has a
much higher chance of success than a <em>ciphertext only</em> attack. Even
better is a <em>chosen plaintext</em> attack, which may be enabled by feeding
some information to the sender that you know the sender is likely to
transmit—such things have happened in wartime, for example.</p>
<p>The best cryptographic algorithms, therefore, can prevent the attacker
from deducing the key even when the individual knows both the
plaintext and the ciphertext. This leaves the attacker with no choice
but to try all the possible keys—exhaustive, “brute force” search. If
keys have <em>n</em> bits, then there are 2<sup>n</sup> possible values for a
key (each of the <em>n</em> bits could be either a zero or a one).  An
attacker could be so lucky as to try the correct value immediately, or
so unlucky as to try every incorrect value before finally trying the
correct value of the key, having tried all 2<sup>n</sup> possible
values; the average number of guesses to discover the correct value is
halfway between those extremes, 2<sup>n/2</sup>.  This can be made
computationally impractical by choosing a sufficiently large key space
and by making the operation of checking a key reasonably costly. What
makes this difficult is that computing speeds keep increasing, making
formerly infeasible computations feasible. Furthermore, although we
are concentrating on the security of data as it moves through the
network—that is, the data is sometimes vulnerable for only a short
period of time—in general, security people have to consider the
vulnerability of data that needs to be stored in archives for tens of
years. This argues for a generously large key size.  On the other
hand, larger keys make encryption and decryption slower.</p>
<p>Most ciphers are <em>block ciphers</em>; they are defined to take as input a
plaintext block of a certain fixed size, typically 64 to 128 bits. Using
a block cipher to encrypt each block independently—known as <em>electronic
codebook (ECB) mode</em> encryption—has the weakness that a given plaintext
block value will always result in the same ciphertext block. Hence,
recurring block values in the plaintext are recognizable as such in the
ciphertext, making it much easier for a cryptanalyst to break the
cipher.</p>
<p>To prevent this, block ciphers are always augmented to make the
ciphertext for a block vary depending on context. Ways in which a
block cipher may be augmented are called <em>modes of operation</em>. A
common mode of operation is <em>cipher block chaining</em> (CBC), in which
each plaintext block is XORed with the previous block’s ciphertext
before being encrypted. The result is that each block’s ciphertext
depends in part on the preceding blocks (i.e., on its context). Since
the first plaintext block has no preceding block, it is XORed with a
random number. That random number, called an <em>initialization vector</em>
(IV), is included with the series of ciphertext blocks so that the
first ciphertext block can be decrypted. This mode is illustrated in
<a class="reference internal" href="#fig-cbc"><span class="std std-numref">Figure 196</span></a>. Another mode of operation is <em>counter
mode</em>, in which successive values of a counter (e.g., 1, 2, 3,
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\ldots\)</span>) are incorporated into the encryption of successive
blocks of plaintext.</p>

secret-key cipher, then the encryption and decryption keys would be
identical. Secret-key ciphers are also known as symmetric-key ciphers
since the secret is shared with both participants. We’ll take a look
at the alternative, public-key ciphers, shortly. (Public-key cipers
are known as also asymmetric-key ciphers, since as we’ll soon se, the
two participants use different keys.)</p>

<p>The U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has
issued standards for a series of secret-key ciphers. <em>Data Encryption
Standard</em> (DES) was the first, and it has stood the test of time in
that no cryptanalytic attack better than brute force search has been
discovered. Brute force search, however, has gotten faster. DES’s keys
(56 independent bits) are now too small given current processor
speeds.  DES keys have 56 independent bits (although they have 64 bits
in total; the last bit of every byte is a parity bit). As noted above,
you would, on average, have to search half of the space of 2<sup>56</sup> possible keys to find the right one, giving 2<sup>55</sup> =
3.6 × 10<sup>16</sup> keys.  That may sound like a lot, but such a
search is highly parallelizable, so it’s possible to throw as many
computers at the task as you can get your hands on—and these days it’s
easy to lay your hands on thousands of computers. (Amazon will rent
them to you for a few cents an hour.) By the late 1990s, it was
already possible to recover a DES key after a few hours. Consequently,
NIST updated the DES standard in 1999 to indicate that DES should only
be used for legacy systems.</p>
<p>NIST also standardized the cipher <em>Triple DES</em> (3DES), which leverages
the cryptanalysis resistance of DES while in effect increasing the key
size. A 3DES key has 168 (= 3 × 56) independent bits, and is used as
three DES keys; let’s call them DES-key1, DES-key2, and DES-key3. 3DES
encryption of a block is performed by first DES encrypting the block
using DES-key1, then DES <em>de</em>crypting the result using DES-key2, and
finally DES encrypting that result using DES-key3. Decryption involves
decrypting using DES-key3, then encrypting using DES-key2, then
decrypting using DES-key1.</p>
<p>The reason 3DES encryption uses DES <em>de</em>cryption with DES-key2 is to
interoperate with legacy DES systems. If a legacy DES system uses a
single key, then a 3DES system can perform the same encryption function
by using that key for each of DES-key1, DES-key2, and DES-key3; in the
first two steps, we encrypt and then decrypt with the same key,
producing the original plaintext, which we then encrypt again.</p>
<p>Although 3DES solves DES’s key-length problem, it inherits some other
shortcomings. Software implementations of DES/3DES are slow because it
was originally designed by IBM for implementation in hardware. Also,
DES/3DES uses a 64-bit block size; a larger block size is more efficient
and more secure.</p>
<p>3DES is now being superseded by the <em>Advanced Encryption Standard</em> (AES)
standard issued by NIST. The cipher underlying AES (with a few minor
modifications) was originally named Rijndael (pronounced roughly like
“Rhine dahl”) based on the names of its inventors, Daemen and Rijmen.
AES supports key lengths of 128, 192, or 256 bits, and the block length
is 128 bits. AES permits fast implementations in both software and
hardware. It doesn’t require much memory, which makes it suitable for
small mobile devices. AES has some mathematically proven security
properties and, as of the time of writing, has not suffered from any
significant successful attacks.</p>

<h2>Public-Key Ciphers<a class="headerlink" href="#public-key-ciphers" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>An alternative to secret-key ciphers is public-key, ciphers. Instead of
a single key shared by two participants, a public-key cipher uses a pair
of related keys, one for encryption and a different one for decryption.
The pair of keys is “owned” by just one participant. The owner keeps the
decryption key secret so that only the owner can decrypt messages; that
key is called the <em>private key</em>. The owner makes the encryption key
public, so that anyone can encrypt messages for the owner; that key is
called the <em>public key</em>. Obviously, for such a scheme to work, it must
not be possible to deduce the private key from the public key.
Consequently, any participant can get the public key and send an
encrypted message to the owner of the keys, and only the owner has the
private key necessary to decrypt it. This scenario is depicted in
<a class="reference internal" href="#fig-public"><span class="std std-numref">Figure 197</span></a>.</p>
<div class="figure align-center" id="id5">
<span id="fig-public"></span><a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/f08-03-9780123850591.png"><img alt="../_images/f08-03-9780123850591.png" src="../_images/f08-03-9780123850591.png" style="width: 500px;" /></a>
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-number">Figure 197. </span><span class="caption-text">Public-key encryption.</span></p>
</div>
<p>Because it is somewhat unintuitive, we emphasize that the public
encryption key is useless for decrypting a message—you couldn’t even
decrypt a message that you yourself had just encrypted unless you had
the private decryption key. If we think of keys as defining a
communication channel between participants, then another difference
between public-key and secret-key ciphers is the topology of the
channels. A key for a secret-key cipher provides a channel that is
two-way between two participants—each participant holds the same
(symmetric) key that either one can use to encrypt or decrypt messages
in either direction. A public/private key pair, in contrast, provides
a channel that is one way and many-to-one: from everyone who has the
public key to the unique owner of the private key, as illustrated in
<a class="reference internal" href="#fig-public"><span class="std std-numref">Figure 197</span></a>.</p>
<p>An important additional property of public-key ciphers is that the
private “decryption” key can be used with the encryption algorithm to
encrypt messages so that they can only be decrypted using the public
“encryption” key. This property clearly wouldn’t be useful for
confidentiality since anyone with the public key could decrypt such a
message. (Indeed, for two-way confidentiality between two
participants, each participant needs its own pair of keys, and each
encrypts messages using the other’s public key.) This property is,
however, useful for authentication since it tells the receiver of such
a message that it could only have been created by the owner of the
keys (subject to certain assumptions that we will get into
later). This is illustrated in <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-pksign"><span class="std std-numref">Figure 198</span></a>. It
should be clear from the figure that anyone with the public key can
decrypt the encrypted message, and, assuming that the result of the
decryption matches the expected result, it can be concluded that the
private key must have been used to perform the encryption. Exactly how
this operation is used to provide authentication is the topic of a
later section. As we will see, public-key ciphers are used primarily
for authentication and to confidentially distribute secret (symmetric)
keys, leaving the rest of confidentiality to secret-key ciphers.</p>

</div>
<p>A bit of interesting history: The concept of public-key ciphers was
first published in 1976 by Diffie and Hellman. Subsequently, however,
documents have come to light proving that Britain’s
Communications-Electronics Security Group had discovered public-key
ciphers by 1970, and the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) claims to
have discovered them in the mid-1960s.</p>
<p>The best-known public-key cipher is RSA, named after its inventors:
Rivest, Shamir, and Adleman. RSA relies on the high computational cost
of factoring large numbers. The problem of finding an efficient way to
factor numbers is one that mathematicians have worked on unsuccessfully
since long before RSA appeared in 1978, and RSA’s subsequent resistance
to cryptanalysis has further bolstered confidence in its security.
Unfortunately, RSA needs relatively large keys, at least 1024 bits, to
be secure. This is larger than keys for secret-key ciphers because it is
faster to break an RSA private key by factoring the large number on
which the pair of keys is based than by exhaustively searching the key
space.</p>
<p>Another public-key cipher is ElGamal. Like RSA, it relies on a
mathematical problem, the discrete logarithm problem, for which no
efficient solution has been found, and requires keys of at least 1024
bits. There is a variation of the discrete logarithm problem, arising
when the input is an elliptic curve, that is thought to be even more
difficult to compute; cryptographic schemes based on this problem are
referred to as <em>elliptic curve cryptography</em>.</p>
<p>Public-key ciphers are, unfortunately, several orders of magnitude
slower than secret-key ciphers. Consequently, secret-key ciphers are
used for the vast majority of encryption, while public-key ciphers are
reserved for use in authentication and session key establishment.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="authenticators">
<h2>Authenticators<a class="headerlink" href="#authenticators" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Encryption alone does not provide data integrity. For example, just
randomly modifying a ciphertext message could turn it into something
that decrypts into valid-looking plaintext, in which case the tampering
would be undetectable by the receiver. Nor does encryption alone provide
authentication. It is not much use to say that a message came from a
certain participant if the contents of the message have been modified
after that participant created it. In a sense, integrity and
authentication are fundamentally inseparable.</p>
<p>An <em>authenticator</em> is a value, to be included in a transmitted message,
that can be used to verify simultaneously the authenticity and the data
integrity of a message. We will see how authenticators can be used in
protocols. For now, we focus on the algorithms that produce
authenticators.</p>
<p>You may recall that checksums and cyclic redundancy checks (CRCs) are
pieces of information added to a message so the receiver detect when the
message has been inadvertently modified by bit errors. A similar concept
applies to authenticators, with the added challenge that the corruption
of the message is likely to be deliberately performed by someone who
wants the corruption to go undetected. To support authentication, an
authenticator includes some proof that whoever created the authenticator
knows a secret that is known only to the alleged sender of the message;
for example, the secret could be a key, and the proof could be some
value encrypted using the key. There is a mutual dependency between the
form of the redundant information and the form of the proof of secret
knowledge. We discuss several workable combinations.</p>
<p>We initially assume that the original message need not be
confidential—that a transmitted message will consist of the plaintext of
the original message plus an authenticator. Later we will consider the
case where confidentiality is desired.</p>
<p>One kind of authenticator combines encryption and a <em>cryptographic hash
function</em>. Cryptographic hash algorithms are treated as public
knowledge, as with cipher algorithms. A cryptographic hash function
(also known as a <em>cryptographic checksum</em>) is a function that outputs
sufficient redundant information about a message to expose any
tampering. Just as a checksum or CRC exposes bit errors introduced by
noisy links, a cryptographic checksum is designed to expose deliberate
corruption of messages by an adversary. The value it outputs is called a
<em>message digest</em> and, like an ordinary checksum, is appended to the
message. All the message digests produced by a given hash have the same
number of bits regardless of the length of the original message. Since
the space of possible input messages is larger than the space of
possible message digests, there will be different input messages that
produce the same message digest, like collisions in a hash table.</p>
<p>An authenticator can be created by encrypting the message digest. The
receiver computes a digest of the plaintext part of the message and
compares that to the decrypted message digest. If they are equal, then
the receiver would conclude that the message is indeed from its alleged
sender (since it would have to have been encrypted with the right key)
and has not been tampered with. No adversary could get away with sending
a bogus message with a matching bogus digest because she would not have
the key to encrypt the bogus digest correctly. An adversary could,
however, obtain the plaintext original message and its encrypted digest
by eavesdropping. The adversary could then (since the hash function is
public knowledge) compute the digest of the original message and
generate alternative messages looking for one with the same message
digest. If she finds one, she could undetectably send the new message
with the old authenticator. Therefore, security requires that the hash
function have the <em>one-way</em> property: It must be computationally
infeasible for an adversary to find any plaintext message that has the
same digest as the original.</p>
<p>For a hash function to meet this requirement, its outputs must be
fairly randomly distributed. For example, if digests are 128 bits long
and randomly distributed, then you would need to try 2<sup>127</sup>
messages, on average, before finding a second message whose digest
matches that of a given message. If the outputs are not randomly
distributed—that is, if some outputs are much more likely than
others—then for some messages you could find another message with the
same digest much more easily than this, which would reduce the
security of the algorithm. If you were instead just trying to find any
<em>collision</em>—any two messages that produce the same digest—then you
would need to compute the digests of only 2<sup>64</sup> messages, on
average.  This surprising fact is the basis of the “birthday
attack”—see the exercises for more details.</p>
<p>There have been several common cryptographic hash algorithms over the
years, including Message Digest 5 (MD5) and the Secure Hash Algorithm
(SHA) family. Weaknesses of MD5 and earlier versions of SHA have been
known for some time, which led NIST to recommend using SHA-3 in 2015.
generating an encrypted message digest, the digest encryption could use
either a secret-key cipher or a public-key cipher. If a public-key
cipher is used, the digest would be encrypted using the sender’s private
key (the one we normally think of as being used for decryption), and the
receiver—or anyone else—could decrypt the digest using the sender’s
public key.</p>
<p>A digest encrypted with a public key algorithm but using the private key
is called a <em>digital signature</em> because it provides nonrepudiation like
a written signature. The receiver of a message with a digital signature
can prove to any third party that the sender really sent that message,
because the third party can use the sender’s public key to check for
herself. (secret-key encryption of a digest does not have this property
because only the two participants know the key; furthermore, since both
participants know the key, the alleged receiver could have created the
message herself.) Any public-key cipher can be used for digital
signatures. <em>Digital Signature Standard</em> (DSS) is a digital signature
format that has been standardized by NIST. DSS signatures may use any
one of three public-key ciphers, one based on RSA, another on ElGamal,
and a third called the <em>Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm</em>.</p>
<p>Another kind of authenticator is similar, but instead of encrypting a
hash it uses a hash-like function that takes a secret value (known
only to the sender and the receiver) as a parameter, as illustrated in
<a class="reference internal" href="#fig-macandhmac"><span class="std std-numref">Figure 199</span></a>. Such a function outputs an
authenticator called a <em>message authentication code</em> (MAC). The sender
appends the MAC to her plaintext message. The receiver recomputes the
MAC using the plaintext and the secret value and compares that
recomputed MAC to the received MAC.</p>

<span id="fig-macandhmac"></span><a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/f08-05-9780123850591.png"><img alt="../_images/f08-05-9780123850591.png" src="../_images/f08-05-9780123850591.png" style="width: 600px;" /></a>
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-number">Figure 199. </span><span class="caption-text">Computing a MAC (a) versus computing an HMAC (b).</span></p>
</div>
<p>A common variation on MACs is to apply a cryptographic hash (such as
MD5 or SHA-1) to the concatenation of the plaintext message and the
secret value, as illustrated in <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-macandhmac"><span class="std std-numref">Figure 199</span></a>. The resulting digest is called a <em>hashed message
authentication code</em> (HMAC) since it is essentially a MAC. The HMAC,
but not the secret value, is appended to the plaintext Only a receiver
who knows the secret value can compute the correct HMAC to compare
with the received HMAC. If it weren’t for the one-way property of the
hash, an adversary might be able to find the input that generated the
HMAC and compare it to the plaintext message to determine the secret
value.</p>
<p>Up to this point, we have been assuming that the message wasn’t
confidential, so the original message could be transmitted as plaintext.
To add confidentiality to a message with an authenticator, it suffices
to encrypt the concatenation of the entire message including its
authenticator—the MAC, HMAC, or encrypted digest. Remember that, in
practice, confidentiality is implemented using secret-key ciphers
because they are so much faster than public-key ciphers. Furthermore, it
costs little to include the authenticator in the encryption, and it
increases security. A common simplification is to encrypt the message
with its (raw) digest, such that the digest is only encrypted once; in
this case, the entire ciphertext message is considered to be an
authenticator.</p>
<p>Although authenticators may seem to solve the authentication problem, we
will see in a later section that they are only the foundation of a
solution. First, however, we address the issue of how participants
obtain keys in the first place.</p>
