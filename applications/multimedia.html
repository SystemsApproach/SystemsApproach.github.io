<p>Just like the traditional applications described earlier in this
chapter, multimedia applications such as telephony and videoconferencing
need their own protocols. Much of the initial experience in designing
protocols for multimedia applications came from the MBone
tools&#x2014;applications such as <code>vat</code> and <code>vic</code> that were developed for
use on the MBone, an overlay network that supports IP multicast to
enable multiparty conferencing. (More on overlay networks including the
MBone in the next section.) Initially, each application implemented its
own protocol (or protocols), but it became apparent that many multimedia
applications have common requirements. This ultimately led to the
development of a number of general-purpose protocols for use by
multimedia applications.</p>
<p>We have already seen a number of protocols that multimedia applications
use. The Real-Time Transport Protocol (RTP) provides many of the
functions that are common to multimedia applications such as conveying
timing information and identifying the coding schemes and media types of
an application.</p>
<p>The Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP) can be used to request the
allocation of resources in the network so that the desired quality of
service (QoS) can be provided to an application. We will see how
resource allocation interacts with other aspects of multimedia
applications later in this section.</p>
<p>In addition to these protocols for multimedia transport and resource
allocation, many multimedia applications also need a signalling or
<em>session control</em> protocol. For example, suppose that we wanted to be
able to make telephone calls across the Internet (Voice over IP, or
VoIP). We would need some mechanism to notify the intended recipient of
such a call that we wanted to talk to her, such as by sending a message
to some multimedia device that would cause it to make a ringing sound.
We would also like to be able to support features like call forwarding,
three-way calling, etc. The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) and H.323
are examples of protocols that address the issues of session control; we
begin our discussion of multimedia applications by examining these
protocols.</p>
<h2 id="session-control-and-call-control-sdp-sip-h323">Session Control and Call Control (SDP, SIP, H.323)</h2>
<p>To understand some of the issues of session control, consider the
following problem. Suppose you want to hold a videoconference at a
certain time and make it available to a wide number of participants.
Perhaps you have decided to encode the video stream using the MPEG-2
standard, to use the multicast IP address 224.1.1.1 for transmission of
the data, and to send it using RTP over UDP port number 4000. How would
you make all that information available to the intended participants?
One way would be to put all that information in an email and send it
out, but ideally there should be a standard format and protocol for
disseminating this sort of information. The IETF has defined protocols
for just this purpose. The protocols that have been defined include</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Session Description Protocol (SDP)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Session Announcement Protocol (SAP)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Simple Conference Control Protocol (SCCP)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You might think that this is a lot of protocols for a seemingly simple
task, but there are many aspects of the problem and several different
situations in which it must be addressed. For example, there is a
difference between announcing the fact that a certain conference session
is going to be made available on the MBone (which would be done using
SDP and SAP) and trying to make an Internet phone call to a certain user
at a particular time (which could be done using SDP and SIP). In the
former case, you could consider your job done once you have sent all the
session information in a standard format to a well-known multicast
address. In the latter, you would need to locate one or more users, get
a message to them announcing your desire to talk (analogous to ringing
their phone), and perhaps negotiate a suitable audio encoding among all
parties. We will look first at SDP, which is common to many
applications, then at SIP, which is widely used for a number of
interactive applications such as Internet telephony.</p>
<h3 id="session-description-protocol-sdp">Session Description Protocol (SDP)</h3>
<p>The Session Description Protocol (SDP) is a rather general protocol that
can be used in a variety of situations and is typically used in
conjunction with one or more other protocols (e.g., SIP). It conveys the
following information:</p>

<p>SDP provides this information formatted in ASCII using a sequence of
lines of text, each of the form &quot;.&quot; An example of an SDP message will
illustrate the main points.</p>

</code></pre>
<p>Note that SDP, like HTML, is fairly easy for a human to read but has
strict formatting rules that make it possible for machines to interpret
the data unambiguously. For example, the SDP specification defines all
the possible information types that are allowed to appear, the order in
which they must appear, and the format and reserved words for every type
that is defined.</p>
<p>The first thing to notice is that each information type is identified by
a single character. For example, the line tells us that &quot;version&quot; has
the value zero; that is, this message is formatted according to version
zero of SDP. The next line provides the &quot;origin&quot; of the session which
contains enough information to uniquely identify the session. <code>larry</code>
is a username of the session creator, and is the IP address of his
computer. The number following <code>larry</code> is a session identifier that is
chosen to be unique to that machine. This is followed by a &quot;version&quot;
number for the SDP announcement; if the session information was updated
by a later message, the version number would be increased.</p>
<p>The next three lines (<code>i</code>, <code>s</code> and <code>u</code>) provide the session name, a
session description, and a session Uniform Resource Identifier (URI, as
described earlier in this chapter)&#x2014;information that would be helpful
to a user in deciding whether to participate in this session. Such
information could be displayed in the user interface of a session
directory tool that shows current and upcoming events that have been
advertised using SDP. The next line (<code>e=...</code>) contains an email
address of a person to contact regarding the session. <a href="#sdr">Figure 1</a>
shows a screen shot of a (somewhat archaic) session directory tool
called <code>sdr</code> along with the descriptions of several sessions that had
been announced at the time the picture was taken.</p>
<figure class="line">

    <figcaption>A session directory tool displays information extracted from
    SDP messages.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Next we get to the technical details that would enable an application
program to participate in the session. The line beginning <code>c=...</code>
provides the
IP multicast address to which data for this session will be sent; a user
would need to join this multicast group to receive the session. Next we
see the start and end times for the session (encoded as integers
according to the Network Time Protocol). Finally, we get to the
information about the media for this session. This session has three
media types available&#x2014;audio, video, and a shared whiteboard
application known as &quot;<code>wb</code>.&quot; For each media type there is one line of
information formatted as follows:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-pseudo">m=&lt;media&gt; &lt;port&gt; &lt;transport&gt; &lt;format&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>The media types are self-explanatory, and the port numbers in each case
are UDP ports. When we look at the &quot;transport&quot; field, we can see that
the <code>wb</code> application runs directly over UDP, while the audio and video
are transported using &quot;RTP/AVP.&quot; This means that they run over RTP and
use the <em>application profile</em> known as <em>AVP</em>. That application profile
defines a number of different encoding schemes for audio and video; we
can see in this case that the audio is using encoding 0 (which is an
encoding using an 8-kHz sampling rate and 8 bits per sample) and the
video is using encoding 31, which represents the H.261 encoding scheme.
These &quot;magic numbers&quot; for the encoding schemes are defined in the RFC
that defines the AVP profile; it is also possible to describe
nonstandard coding schemes in SDP.</p>
<p>Finally, we see a description of the &quot;wb&quot; media type. All the encoding
information for this data is specific to the <code>wb</code> application, and so
it is sufficient just to provide the name of the application in the
&quot;format&quot; field. This is analogous to putting <code>application/wb</code> in a
MIME message.</p>
<p>Now that we know how to describe sessions, we can look at how they can
be initiated. One way in which SDP is used is to announce multimedia
conferences, by sending SDP messages to a well-known multicast address.
The session directory tool shown in <a href="#sdr">Figure 1</a> would function by
joining that multicast group and displaying information that it gleans
from received SDP messages. SDP is also used in the delivery of
entertainment video of IP (often called IPTV) to provide information
about the video content on each TV channel.</p>
<p>SDP also plays an important role in conjunction with the Session
Initiation Protocol (SIP). With the widespread adoption of Voice over IP
(i.e., the support of telephony-like applications over IP networks) and
IP-based video conferencing, SIP is now one of the more important
members of the Internet protocol suite.</p>
<h3 id="sip">SIP</h3>
<p>SIP is an application layer protocol that bears a certain resemblance to
HTTP, being based on a similar request/response model. However, it is
designed with rather different sorts of applications in mind and thus
provides quite different capabilities than HTTP. The capabilities
provided by SIP can be grouped into five categories:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>User location&#x2014;Determining the correct device with which to
 communicate to reach a particular user</p>
</li>
<li><p>User availability&#x2014;Determining if the user is willing or able to
 take part in a particular communication session</p>
</li>
<li><p>User capabilities&#x2014;Determining such items as the choice of media
 and coding scheme to use</p>
</li>
<li><p>Session setup&#x2014;Establishing session parameters such as port numbers
 to be used by the communicating parties</p>
</li>
<li><p>Session management&#x2014;A range of functions including transferring
 sessions (e.g., to implement &quot;call forwarding&quot;) and modifying
 session parameters</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Most of these functions are easy enough to understand, but the issue of
location bears some further discussion. One important difference between
SIP and, say, HTTP, is that SIP is primarily used for human-to-human
communication. Thus, it is important to be able to locate individual
<em>users</em>, not just machines. And, unlike email, it&apos;s not good enough just
to locate a server that the user will be checking on at some later date
and dump the message there&#x2014;we need to know where the user is right now
if we want to be able to communicate with him in real time. This is
further complicated by the fact that a user might choose to communicate
using a range of different devices, such as using his desktop PC when
he&apos;s in the office and using a handheld device when traveling. Multiple
devices might be active at the same time and might have widely different
capabilities (e.g., an alphanumeric pager and a PC-based video &quot;phone&quot;).
Ideally, it should be possible for other users to be able to locate and
communicate with the appropriate device at any time. Furthermore, the
user must be able to have control over when, where, and from whom he
receives calls.</p>
<p>To enable a user to exercise the appropriate level of control over his
calls, SIP introduces the notion of a proxy. A SIP proxy can be thought
of as a point of contact for a user to which initial requests for
communication with him are sent. Proxies also perform functions on
behalf of callers. We can see how proxies work best through an example.</p>
<figure class="line">
    <a id="sipproxy"></a>
    <img src="figures/f09-08-9780123850591.png" width="600px">
    <figcaption>Establishing communication through SIP proxies.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Consider the two users in <a href="#sipproxy">Figure 2</a>. The first thing to
notice is that each user has a name in the format , very much like an
email address. When user Bruce wants to initiate a session with Larry,
he sends his initial SIP message to the local proxy for his domain, .
Among other things, this initial message contains a <em>SIP URI</em>&#x2014;these
are a form of uniform resource identifier which look like this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-pseudo">SIP:larry@princeton.edu
</code></pre>
<p>A SIP URI provides complete identification of a user, but (unlike a URL)
does not provide his location, since that may change over time. We will
see shortly how the location of a user can be determined.</p>
<p>Upon receiving the initial message from Bruce, the proxy looks at the
SIP URI and deduces that this message should be sent to the proxy. For
now, we assume that the proxy has access to some database that enables
it to obtain a mapping from the name to the IP address of one or more
devices at which Larry currently wishes to receive messages. The proxy
can therefore forward the message on to Larry&apos;s chosen device(s).
Sending the message to more than one device is called <em>forking</em> and may
be done either in parallel or in series (e.g., send it to his mobile
phone if he doesn&apos;t answer the phone at his desk).</p>
<p>The initial message from Bruce to Larry is likely to be a SIP <code>invite</code>
message, which looks something like the following:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-pseudo">INVITE sip:larry@princeton.edu SIP/2.0
Via: SIP/2.0/UDP bsd-pc.cisco.com;branch=z9hG4bK433yte4
To: Larry &lt;sip:larry@princeton.edu&gt;
From: Bruce &lt;sip:bruce@cisco.com&gt;;tag=55123
Call-ID: xy745jj210re3@bsd-pc.cisco.com
CSeq: 271828 INVITE
Contact: &lt;sip:bruce@bsd-pc.cisco.com&gt;
Content-Type: application/sdp
Content-Length: 142
</code></pre>
<p>The first line identifies the type of function to be performed
(<code>invite</code>); the resource on which to perform it, the called party ( );
and the protocol version (2.0). The subsequent header lines probably
look somewhat familiar because of their resemblance to the header lines
in an email message. SIP defines a large number of header fields, only
some of which we describe here. Note that the header in this example
identifies the device from which this message originated. The and
headers describe the contents of the message following the header, just
as in a MIME-encoded email message. In this case, the content is an SDP
message. That message would describe such things as the type of media
(audio, video, etc.) that Bruce would like to exchange with Larry and
other properties of the session such as codec types that he supports.
Note that the field in SIP provides the capability to use any protocol
for this purpose, although SDP is the most common.</p>
<p>Returning to the example, when the <code>invite</code> message arrives at the
proxy, not only does the proxy forward the message on toward , but it
also responds to the sender of the <code>invite</code>. Just as in HTTP, all
responses have a response code, and the organization of codes is similar
to that for HTTP. In <a href="#sipeg">Figure 3</a> we can see a sequence of SIP
messages and responses.</p>
<figure class="line">
    <a id="sipeg"></a>
    <img src="figures/f09-09-9780123850591.png" width="650px">
    <figcaption>Message flow for a basic SIP session.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The first response message in this figure is the provisional response ,
which indicates that the message was received without error by the
caller&apos;s proxy. Once the <code>invite</code> is delivered to Larry&apos;s phone, it
alerts Larry and responds with a message. The arrival of this message at
Bruce&apos;s computer is a sign that it can generate a &quot;ringtone.&quot; Assuming
Larry is willing and able to communicate with Bruce, he could pick up
his phone, causing the message to be sent. Bruce&apos;s computer responds
with an <code>ACK</code>, and media (e.g., an RTP-encapsulated audio stream) can
now begin to flow between the two parties. Note that at this point the
parties know each others&apos; addresses, so the <code>ACK</code> can be sent
directly, bypassing the proxies. The proxies are now no longer involved
in the call. Note that the media will therefore typically take a
different path through the network than the original signalling
messages. Furthermore, even if one or both of the proxies were to crash
at this point, the call could continue on normally. Finally, when one
party wishes to end the session, it sends a <code>BYE</code> message, which
elicits a response under normal circumstances.</p>
<p>There are a few details that we have glossed over. One is the
negotiation of session characteristics. Perhaps Bruce would have liked
to communicate using both audio and video but Larry&apos;s phone only
supports audio. Thus, Larry&apos;s phone would send an SDP message in its
describing the properties of the session that will be acceptable to
Larry and the device, considering the options that were proposed in
Bruce&apos;s <code>invite</code>. In this way, mutually acceptable session parameters
are agreed to before the media flow starts.</p>
<p>The other big issue we have glossed over is that of locating the correct
device for Larry. First, Bruce&apos;s computer had to send its <code>invite</code> to
the proxy. This could have been a configured piece of information in the
computer, or it could have been learned by DHCP. Then the proxy had to
find the proxy. This could be done using a special sort of DNS lookup
that would return the IP address of the SIP proxy for the domain. (We&apos;ll
discuss how DNS can do this in the next section.) Finally, the proxy had
to find a device on which Larry could be contacted. Typically, a proxy
server has access to a location database that can be populated in
several ways. Manual configuration is one option, but a more flexible
option is to use the <em>registration</em> capabilities of SIP.</p>
<p>A user can register with a location service by sending a SIP
<code>register</code> message to the &quot;registrar&quot; for his domain. This message
creates a binding between an &quot;address of record&quot; and a &quot;contact
address.&quot; An &quot;address of record&quot; is likely to be a SIP URI that is the
well-known address for the user (e.g., ) and the &quot;contact address&quot; will
be the address at which the user can currently be found (e.g., ). This
is exactly the binding that was needed by the proxy in our example.</p>
<p>Note that a user may register at several locations and that multiple
users may register at a single device. For example, one can imagine a
group of people walking into a conference room that is equipped with an
IP phone and all of them registering on it so that they can receive
calls on that phone.</p>
<p>SIP is a very rich and flexible protocol that can support a wide range
of complex calling scenarios as well as applications that have little or
nothing to do with telephony. For example, SIP supports operations that
enable a call to be routed to a &quot;music-on-hold&quot; server or a voicemail
server. It is also easy to see how it could be used for applications
like instant messaging, and standardization of SIP extensions for such
purposes is ongoing at the time of writing.</p>
<h3 id="h323">H.323</h3>
<p>The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) has also been very
active in the call control area, which is not surprising given its
relevance to telephony, the traditional realm of that body. Fortunately,
there has been considerable coordination between the IETF and the ITU in
this instance, so that the various protocols are somewhat interoperable.
The major ITU recommendation for multimedia communication over packet
networks is known as <em>H.323</em>, which ties together many other
recommendations, including H.225 for call control. The full set of
recommendations covered by H.323 runs to many hundreds of pages, and the
protocol is known for its complexity, so it is only possible to give a
brief overview of it here.</p>
<p>H.323 is popular as a protocol for Internet telephony, including video
calls, and we consider that class of application here. A device that
originates or terminates calls is known as an H.323 terminal; this might
be a workstation running an Internet telephony application, or it might
be a specially designed &quot;appliance&quot;&#x2014;a telephone-like device with
networking software and an Ethernet port, for example. H.323 terminals
can talk to each other directly, but the calls are frequently mediated
by a device known as a <em>gatekeeper</em>. Gatekeepers perform a number of
functions such as translating among the various address formats used for
phone calls and controlling how many calls can be placed at a given time
to limit the bandwidth used by the H.323 applications. H.323 also
includes the concept of a <em>gateway</em>, which connects the H.323 network to
other types of networks. The most common use of a gateway is to connect
an H.323 network to the public switched telephone network (PSTN) as
illustrated in <a href="#h323">Figure 4</a>. This enables a user running an H.323
application on a computer to talk to a person using a conventional phone
on the public telephone network. One useful function performed by the
gatekeeper is to help a terminal find a gateway, perhaps choosing among
several options to find one that is relatively close to the ultimate
destination of the call. This is clearly useful in a world where
conventional phones greatly outnumber PC-based phones. When an H.323
terminal makes a call to an endpoint that is a conventional phone, the
gateway becomes the effective endpoint for the H.323 call and is
responsible for performing the appropriate translation of both
signalling information and the media stream that need to be carried over
the telephone network.</p>
<figure class="line">
    <a id="h323"></a>
    <img src="figures/f09-10-9780123850591.png" width="500px">
    <figcaption>Devices in an H.323 network.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>An important part of H.323 is the H.245 protocol, which is used to
negotiate the properties of the call, somewhat analogously to the use of
SDP described above. H.245 messages might list a number of different
audio codec standards that it can support; the far endpoint of the call
would reply with a list of its own supported codecs, and the two ends
could pick a coding standard that they can both live with. H.245 can
also be used to signal the UDP port numbers that will be used by RTP and
Real-Time Control Protocol (RTCP) for the media stream (or streams&#x2014;a
call might include both audio and video, for example) for this call.
Once this is accomplished, the call can proceed, with RTP being used to
transport the media streams and RTCP carrying the relevant control
information.</p>
<h2 id="resource-allocation-for-multimedia-applications">Resource Allocation for Multimedia Applications</h2>
<p>As we have just seen, session control protocols like SIP and H.323 can
be used to initiate and control communication in multimedia
applications, while RTP provides transport-level functions for the data
streams of the applications. A final piece of the puzzle in getting
multimedia applications to work is making sure that suitable resources
are allocated inside the network to ensure that the quality of service
needs of the application are met. We presented a number of methods for
resource allocation in an earlier chapter. The motivation for developing
these technologies was largely for the support of multimedia
applications. So how do applications take advantage of the underlying
resource allocation capabilities of the network?</p>
<p>It is worth noting that many multimedia applications run successfully
over &quot;best-effort&quot; networks, such as the public Internet. The wide array
of commercial VOIP services (such as Skype) are testimony to the fact
that you only have to worry about resource allocation when resources are
not abundant&#x2014;and in many parts of today&apos;s Internet, resource abundance
is the norm.</p>
<p>A protocol like RTCP can help applications in best-effort networks, by
giving the application detailed information about the quality of service
that is being delivered by the network. Recall that RTCP carries
information about the loss rate and delay characteristics between
participants in a multimedia application. An application can use this
information to change its coding scheme&#x2014;changing to a lower bitrate
codec, for example, when bandwidth is scarce. Note that, while it might
be tempting to change to a codec that sends additional, redundant
information when loss rates are high, this is frowned upon; it is
analogous to <em>increasing</em> the window size of TCP in the presence of
loss, the exact opposite of what is required to avoid congestion
collapse.</p>
<p>As discussed in an earlier chapter, Differentiated Services (DiffServ)
can be used to provide fairly basic and scalable resource allocation to
applications. A multimedia application can set the differentiated
services code point (DSCP) in the IP header of the packets that it
generates in an effort to ensure that both the media and control packets
receive appropriate quality of service. For example, it is common to
mark voice media packets as &quot;EF&quot; (expedited forwarding) to cause them to
be placed in a low-latency or priority queue in routers along the path,
while the call signalling (e.g., SIP) packets are often marked with some
sort of &quot;AF&quot; (assured forwarding) to enable them to be queued separately
from best-effort traffic and thus reduce their risk of loss.</p>
<p>Of course, it only makes sense to mark the packets inside the sending
host or appliance if network devices such as routers pay attention to
the DSCP. In general, routers in the public Internet ignore the DSCP,
providing best-effort service to all packets. However, enterprise or
corporate networks have the ability to use DiffServ for their internal
multimedia traffic, and frequently do so. Also, even residential users
of the Internet can often improve the quality of VOIP or other
multimedia applications just by using DiffServ on the outbound direction
of their Internet connections, as illustrated in <a href="#ds-bb">Figure 5</a>.
This is effective because of the asymmetry of many broadband Internet
connections: If the outbound link is substantially slower (i.e., more
resource constrained) than the inbound, then resource allocation using
DiffServ on that link may be enough to make all the difference in
quality for latency- and loss-sensitive applications.</p>
<figure class="line">
    <a id="ds-bb"></a>
    <img src="figures/f09-11-9780123850591.png" width="500px">
    <figcaption>Differentiated Services applied to a VOIP application.
    DiffServ queueing is applied only on the upstream link from customer
    router to ISP.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>While DiffServ is appealing for its simplicity, it is clear that it
cannot meet the needs of applications under all conditions. For example,
suppose the upstream bandwidth in <a href="#ds-bb">Figure 5</a> is only 100 kbps,
and the customer attempts to place two VOIP calls, each with a 64-kbps
codec. Clearly the upstream link is now more than 100% loaded, which
will lead to large queueing delays and lost packets. No amount of clever
queueing in the customer&apos;s router can fix that.</p>
<p>The characteristics of many multimedia applications are such that,
rather than try to squeeze too many calls into a too-narrow pipe, it
would be better to block one call while allowing another to proceed.
That is, it is better to have one person carrying on a conversation
successfully while another hears a busy signal than to have both callers
experiencing unacceptable audio quality at the same time. We sometimes
refer to such applications as having a <em>steep utility curve</em>, meaning
that the utility (usefulness) of the application drops rapidly as the
quality of service provided by the network degrades. Multimedia
applications often have this property, whereas many traditional
applications do not. Email, for example, continues to work quite well
even if delays run into the hours.</p>
<p>Applications with steep utility curves are often well suited to some
form of admission control. If you cannot be sure that sufficient
resources will always be available to support the offered load of the
applications, then admission control provides a way to say &quot;no&quot; to some
applications while allowing others to get the resources they need.</p>
<p>We saw one way to do admission control using RSVP in an earlier chapter,
and we will return to that shortly, but multimedia applications that use
session control protocols provide some other admission control options.
The key point to observe here is that session control protocols like SIP
or H.323 often involve some sort of message exchange between an endpoint
and another entity (SIP proxy or H.323 gatekeeper) at the beginning of a
call or session. This can provide a handy means to say &quot;no&quot; to a new
call for which sufficient resources are not available.</p>
<p>As an example, consider the network in <a href="#cm-cac">Figure 6</a>. Suppose the
wide area link from the branch office to the head office has enough
bandwidth to accommodate three VOIP calls simultaneously using 64-kbps
codecs. Each phone already needs to communicate with the local SIP proxy
or H.323 gatekeeper when it begins to place a call, so it is easy enough
for the proxy/gatekeeper to send back a message that tells the IP phone
to play a busy signal if that link is already fully loaded. The proxy or
gatekeeper can even deal with the possibility that a particular IP phone
might be making multiple calls at the same time and that different codec
speeds might be used. However, this scheme will work only if no other
device can overload the link without first talking to the gatekeeper or
proxy. DiffServ queueing can be used to ensure that, for example, a PC
engaged in a file transfer doesn&apos;t interfere with the VOIP calls. But,
suppose some VOIP application that doesn&apos;t first talk to the gatekeeper
or proxy is enabled in the remote office. Such an application, if it can
get its packets marked appropriately and in the same queue as the
existing VOIP traffic, can clearly drive the link to the point of
overload with no feedback from the proxy or gatekeeper.</p>

    <figcaption>Admission control using session control
    protocol.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Another problem with the approach just described is that it depends on
the gatekeeper or proxy having knowledge of the path that each
application will use. In the simple topology of <a href="#cm-cac">Figure 6</a>
this isn&apos;t a big issue, but in more complex networks it can quickly
become unmanageable. We only need to imagine the case where the remote
office has two different connections to the outside world to see that we
are asking the proxy or gatekeeper to understand not just SIP or H.323
but also routing, link failures, and current network conditions. This
can quickly become unmanageable.</p>
<p>We refer to the sort of admission control just described as <em>off-path</em>,
in the sense that the device making admission control decisions does not
sit on the data path where resources need to be allocated. The obvious
alternative is <em>on-path</em> admission control, and the standard example of
a protocol that does on-path admission control in IP networks is the
Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP). We saw in an earlier chapter how
RSVP can be used to ensure that sufficient resources are allocated along
a path, and it is straightforward to use RSVP in applications like those
described in this section. The one detail that still needs to be filled
in is how the admission control protocol interacts with the session
control protocol.</p>

    <figcaption>Coordination of SIP signalling and resource
    reservation.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Coordinating the actions of an admission control (or resource
reservation) protocol and a session control protocol is not rocket
science, but it does require some attention to details. As an example,
consider a simple telephone call between two parties. Before you can
make a reservation, you need to know how much bandwidth the call is
going to use, which means you need to know what codecs are to be used.
That implies you need to do some of the session control first, to
exchange information about the codecs supported by the two phones.
However, you can&apos;t do <em>all</em> the session control first, because you
wouldn&apos;t want the phone to ring before the admission control decision
had been made, in case admission control failed. <a href="#sip-sync">Figure 7</a>
illustrates this situation where SIP is used for session control and
RSVP is used to make the admission control decision (successfully in
this case).</p>
<p>The main thing to notice here is the interleaving of session control and
resource allocation tasks. Solid lines represent SIP messages, dashed
lines represent RSVP messages. Note that SIP messages are transmitted
direction from phone to phone in this example (i.e., we have not shown
any SIP proxies), whereas the RSVP messages are also processed by the
routers in the middle as the check for sufficient resources to admit the
call.</p>
<p>We begin with an initial exchange of codec information in the first two
SIP messages (recall that SDP is used to list available codecs, among
other things). <code>PRACK</code> is a &quot;provisional acknowledgment.&quot; Once these
messages have been exchanged, RSVP <code>PATH</code> messages, which contain a
description of the amount of resources that will be required, can be
sent as the first step in reserving resources in both directions of the
call. Next, <code>RESV</code> messages can be sent back to actually reserve the
resources. Once a <code>RESV</code> is received by the initiating phone, it can
send an updated SDP message reporting the fact that resources have been
reserved in one direction. When the called phone has received both that
message and the <code>RESV</code> from the other phone, it can start to ring and
tell the other phone that resources are now reserved in both directions
(with the SDP message) and also notify the calling phone that it is
ringing. From here on, normal SIP signalling and media flow, similar to
that shown in <a href="#sipeg">Figure 3</a>, proceeds.</p>
<p>Again we see how building applications requires us to understand the
interaction between different building blocks (SIP and RSVP, in this
case). The designers of SIP actually made some changes to the protocol
to enable this interleaving of functions between protocols with
different jobs, hence our repeated emphasis in this book on focusing on
complete systems rather than just looking at one layer or component in
isolation from the other parts of the system.</p>
