> One way to characterize networks is according to their size. Two 
> well-known examples are LANs (local area networks) and WANs (wide area 
> networks); the former typically extend less than 1 km, while the 
> latter can be worldwide. Other networks are classified as MANs 
> (metropolitan area networks), which usually span tens of kilometers. 
> The reason such classifications are interesting is that the size of a 
> network often has implications for the underlying technology that can 
> be used, with a key factor being the amount of time it takes for data 
> to propagate from one end of the network to the other; we discuss this 
> issue more in later chapters. 
> 
> An interesting historical note is that the term "wide area network"
> was not applied to the first WANs because there was no other sort of 
> network to differentiate them from. When computers were incredibly 
> rare and expensive, there was no point in thinking about how to 
> connect all the computers in the local area—there was only one 
> computer in that area. Only as computers began to proliferate did LANs 
> become necessary, and the term "WAN" was then introduced to describe 
> the larger networks that interconnected geographically distant 
> computers. 
> 
> Another kind of network that we need to be aware of is SANs (usually 
> now expanded as storage area networks, but formerly also known as 
> system area networks). SANs are usually confined to a single room and 
> connect the various components of a large computing system. For 
> example, Fiber Channel is a common SAN technology used to connect high 
> performance computing systems to storage servers and data vaults. 
> Although this book does not describe such networks in detail, they are 
> worth knowing about because they are often at the leading edge in 
> terms of performance, and because it is increasingly common to connect 
> such networks into LANs and WANs.
