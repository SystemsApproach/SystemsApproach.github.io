> decompressor (in series), $$B_n$$ is the network bandwidth (including
> network processing costs) for uncompressed data, $$r$$ is the average

> before any of it is transmitted, then the time taken to send $$x$$Â bytes

> send the compressed data is $$x/B_c + x/(rB_n)$$ Thus, compression
> is beneficial if $$x/B_c + x/(rB_n) < x/B_n$$ which is equivalent
