> The ABR mechanisms operate over a virtual circuit by exchanging
> special ATM cells called resource management (RM) cells between the
> source and destination of the VC. The goal of sending the RM cells is
> to get information about the state of congestion in the network back
> to the source so that it can send traffic at an appropriate rate. In
> this respect, RM cells are an explicit congestion feedback mechanism.
> This is similar to the DECbit,
> but contrasts with TCP's use of implicit
> feedback, which depends on packet losses to detect congestion. It is
> also similar to the new "quick-start" mechanism for TCP.

> Initially, the source sends the cell to the destination and includes
> in it the rate at which it would like to send data cells. Switches
> along the path look at the requested rate and decide if sufficient
> resources are available to handle that rate, based on the amount of
> traffic being carried on other circuits. If enough resources are
> available, the RM cell is passed on unmodified; otherwise, the
> requested rate is decreased before the cell is passed along. At the
> destination, the RM cell is turned around and sent back to the source,
> which thereby learns what rate it can send at.
> 
> The intention of ABR is to allow a source to increase or decrease its
> allotted rate as conditions dictate. Hence, RM cells are sent
> periodically and may contain either higher or lower requested rates.
> Also, the rate at which a source is allowed to send decays with time
> if not used. In general, proprietary algorithms in the switches
> determine the rates that are placed in RM cells as they pass through
> the switches; the algorithms draw on a variety of information such as
> the current buffer occupancy and the measured arrival rates on
> currently active VCs. These algorithms, as is normal for
> congestion-control algorithms, seek to maximize throughput and to keep
> delay and loss low.

> Given the relative decline of ATM in real networks today, the
> interesting point of ATM QoS is how many mechanisms are common across
> different technologies. Mechanisms that are found in both ATM and IP
> QoS include admission control, scheduling algorithms, token bucket
