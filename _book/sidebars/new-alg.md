> Suppose you develop a new congestion-control mechanism and want to

> measuring and evaluating your mechanism? Although at one time the
> Internet's primary purpose in life was to support networking research,
> today it is a large production network and therefore completely
> inappropriate for running a controlled experiment.

> If your approach is purely end to endâ€”that is, if it assumes only
> FIFO routers within the Internetâ€”then it is possible to run your
> congestion-control mechanism on a small set of hosts and to measure
> the throughput your connections are able to achieve. We need to add a
> word of caution here, however. It is surprisingly easy to invent a
> congestion-control mechanism that achieves five times the throughput
> of TCP across the Internet. You simply blast packets into the Internet
> at a high rate, thereby causing congestion. All the other hosts
> running TCP detect this congestion and reduce the rate at which they
> are sending packets. Your mechanism then happily consumes all the
> bandwidth. This strategy is fast but hardly fair.
> 
> Experimenting directly on the Internet, even when done carefully, will
> not work when your congestion-control mechanism involves changes to
> the routers. It is simply not practical to change the software running
> on thousands of routers for the sake of evaluating a new
> congestion-control algorithm. In this case, network designers are
> forced to test their systems on simulated networks or private testbed
> networks. For example, the TCP traces presented in this chapter were
> generated by an implementation of TCP that was running on a network
> simulator. The challenge in either a simulation or a testbed is coming
> up with a topology and a traffic workload that are representative of
> the real Internet.
