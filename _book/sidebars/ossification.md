> Given its popularity and wide-spread use, it is easy to forget that at
> one time the Internet was a laboratory for researchers to experiment
> with packet-switched networking. The more the Internet has become a
> commercial success, however, the less useful it is as a platform for
> playing with new ideas. Today, commercial interests shape the
> Internet's continued development.
> 
> In fact, as far back as 2001, a report from the National Research
> Council pointed to the ossification of the Internet, both
> intellectually (pressure for compatibility with current standards
> stifles innovation) and in terms of the infrastructure itself (it is
> nearly impossible for researchers to affect the core infrastructure).
> The report went on to observe that at the same time, a whole new set
> of challenges were emerging that may require a fresh approach. The
> dilemma, according to the report, is that
> 
> *...successful and widely adopted technologies are subject to
> ossification, which makes it hard to introduce new capabilities or,
> if the current technology has run its course, to replace it with
> something better. Existing industry players are not generally
> motivated to develop or deploy disruptive technologies...*
>
> Finding the right way to introduce disruptive technologies is an
> interesting issue. Such innovations are likely to do some things very
> well, but overall they lag present technology in other important
> areas. For example, to introduce a new routing strategy into the
> Internet, one would have to build a router that not only supports this
> new strategy, but also competes with established vendors in terms of
> performance, reliability, management toolset, and so on. This is an
> extremely tall order. What the innovator needs is a way to allow users
> to take advantage of the new idea without having to write the hundreds
> of thousands of lines of code needed to support just the base system.
> 
> Overlay networks provide exactly this opportunity. Overlay nodes can
> be programmed to support the new capability or feature, and then
> depend on conventional nodes to provide the underlying connectivity.
> Over time, if the idea deployed in the overlay proves useful, there
> may be economic motivation to migrate the functionality into the base
> system, that is, add it to the feature set of commercial routers. On
> the other hand, the functionality may be complex enough that an
> overlay layer may be exactly where it belongs.
