<p>In addition to the Ethernet and Wi-Fi connections we typically use to
connect to the Internet at home, at work, at school, and in many
public spaces, most of us connect to the Internet over an <em>access</em> or
<em>broadband</em> service that we buy from an ISP. This section
describes two such technologies: <em>Passive Optical Networks</em> (PON),
commonly referred to as fiber-to-the-home, and <em>Cellular Networks</em>
that connect our mobile devices. In both cases, the networks are
multi-access (like Ethernet and Wi-Fi), but as we will see, their
approach to mediating access is quite different.</p>
<p>To set a little more context, ISPs (often a Telco or Cable company)
often operate a national backbone, and connected to the periphery
of that backbone are hundreds or thousands of edge sites, each of
which serves a city or neighborhood. These edge sites are commonly
called <em>Central Offices</em> in the Telco world and <em>Head Ends</em> in the
cable world, but despite their names implying &quot;centralized&quot; and
&quot;root of the hierarchy&quot; these sites are at the very edge of the ISP&apos;s
network; the ISP-side of the last-mile that directly connects to
customers. PON and Cellular access networks are anchored in these
facilities.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>DSL is the legacy, copper-based counterpart to PON. DSL links are 
also terminated in Telco Central Offices, but we do not describe 
this technology since it is being phased out. </p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="passive-optical-network">Passive Optical Network</h2>
<p>PON is the technology most commonly used to deliver fiber-based
broadband to homes and businesses. PON adopts a point-to-multipoint
design, which means the network is structured as a tree, with a single
point starting in the ISP&apos;s network and then fanning out to reach up
to 1024 homes. PON gets its name from the fact that the
splitters are passive: they forward optical signls downstream and
upstream without actively storing-and-forwarding frames. In this way,
they are the optical variant of repeaters used in the classic Ethernet.
Framing then happens at the source in the ISP&apos;s premises, in a device
called an <em>Optical Line Terminal</em> (OLT), and at the end-points in
individual homes, in a device called an <em>Optical Network Unit</em> (ONU).</p>
<p><a href="#pon">Figure 1</a> shows an example PON, simplified to depict just one
ONU and one OLT. In practice, a Central Office would include multiple
OLTs connecting to thousands of customer homes. For completeness,
<a href="#pon">Figure 1</a> also includes two other details about how the PON is
connected to the ISP&apos;s backbone (and hence, to the rest of the
Internet). The <em>Agg Switch</em> aggregates traffic from a set of OLTs, and
the <em>BNG</em> (Broadband Network Gateway) is a piece of Telco equipment
that, among many other things, meters Internet traffic for the sake
of billing. As its name implies, the BNG is effectively the gateway
between the access network (everything to the left of the BNG) and the
Internet (everything to the right of the BNG).</p>

    <a id="pon"></a>

    <figcaption>An example PON that connects OLTs in the Central Office 
    to ONUs in homes and businesses.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Because the splitters are passive, PON has to implement some form of
multi-access protocol. The approach it adopts can be summarized as
follows. First, upstream and downstream traffic are transmitted on two
diffrent optical wavelengths, so they are completely independent of
each other. Downstream traffic starts at the OLT and the signal is
propogated down every link in the PON. As a consequence, every frame
reaches every ONU. This device then looks at a unique identifier in
the individual frames sent over the wavelength, and either keeps the
frame (if the identifier is for it) or drops it (if not). Encryption is
used to keep ONUs from eavesdropping on their neighbors&apos; traffic.</p>
<p>Upstream traffic is then time-division multiplexed on the upstream
wavelength, with each ONU periodically getting a turn to transmit.
Because the ONUs are distributed over a fairly wide area (measured
in kilometers) and at different distances from the OLT, it is not
practical for them to transmit based on synchronized clocks, as in
SONET. Instead, the ONT transmits <em>grants</em> to the individual ONUs,
giving them a time interval during which they can transmit. In other
words, the single OLT is responsible for centrally implementing the
round-robin sharing of the shared PON. This includes the possibility
that the OLT can grant each ONU a different share of time, effectively
implementing different levels of service.</p>
<p>PON is similar to Ethernet in the sense that it defines a sharing
algorithm that has evolved over time to accommodate higher and higher
bandwidths. G-PON (Gigabit-PON) is the most widely deployed today,
supporting a bandwidth of 2.25-Gbps. XGS-PON (10 Gigabit-PON) is just
now starting to be deployed.</p>
<h2 id="cellular-network">Cellular Network</h2>
<p>While cellular telephone technology had its roots in analog voice 
communication, data services based on cellular standards are now
the norm, thanks in no small part to the increasing capabilities
of smartphones. Like Wi-Fi, cellular networks transmit data at certain
bandwidths in the radio spectrum. Unlike Wi-Fi, which permits anyone
to use a channel at either 2.4 or 5 GHz (all you have to do is set up a
base station, as many of us do in our homes), exclusive use of various
frequency bands have been auctioned off and licensed to service
providers, who in turn sell mobile access service to their subscribers.</p>
<p>The frequency bands that are used for cellular networks vary around
the world, and are complicated by the fact that ISPs often
simultaneously support both old/legacy technologies and
new/next-generation technologies, each of which occupies a different
frequency band. The high-level summary is that traditional cellular
technolgies range from 700-MHz to 2400-MHz, with new mid-spectrum
allocations now happening at 6-GHz and millimeter-wave (mmWave)
allocations openning above 24-GHz. One interesting
footnote is that there is also an unlicensed band at 3.5-GHz set aside
in North America, called <em>Citizens Broadband Radio Service</em> (CBRS),
that anyone with a cellular radio can use. This opens the door for
setting up private cellular networks.</p>
<p>Like 802.11, cellular technology relies on the use of base stations
that are connected to a wired network. In the case of the cellular
network, the base stations are often called <em>Broadband Base Units</em>
(BBU), the mobile devices that connect to them are usually referred to
as <em>User Equipment</em> (UE), and the set of BBUs are anchored at an <em>Evolved
Packet Core</em> (EPC) hosted in a Central Office. The wireless network
served by the EPC is often called a <em>Radio Access Network</em> (RAN).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>BBUs currently go by another name&#x2014;Evolved NodeB, often abbreviated
eNodeB or eNB&#x2014;where NodeB is what the radio unit was called in an
early incarnation of cellular networks (and has since evolved).
Given that the cellular world continues to evolve at a rapid pace
and there&apos;s good reason to believe eNB will be out-of-date before
long, we have decided to use the more generic and less cryptic BBU.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="#ran">Figure 2</a> depicts one possible configuration of the end-to-end
scenario, with a few additional bits of detail. The EPC has multiple
subcomponents, including an MME (Mobility Management Entity), an
HSS (Home Subscriber Server), and an S/PGW (Session/Packet Gateway)
pair; the first tracks and manages the movement of UEs throughout the
RAN, the second is a database that contains subscriber-related
information, and the Gateway pair processes and forwards packets
between the RAN and the Internet (it forms the EPC&apos;s <em>user plane</em>).
We say &quot;one possible configuration&quot; because the celluar standards
allow wide variability in how many S/PGWs a given MME is responsible
for, making is possible for a single MME to manage mobility across a
wide geographic area that is served by multiple Central
Offices. Finally, while not explicitly spelled out in
<a href="#ran">Figure 2</a>, it is sometimes the case that the ISP&apos;s PON network
is used to connect the remote BBUs back to the Central Office.</p>

</figure>

<p>The geographic area served by a BBU&apos;s antenna is called a <em>cell</em>.
A BBU could serve a single cell or use multiple directional antennas
to serve multiple cells. Cells don&apos;t have crisp boundaries, and they
overlap. Where they overlap, an UE could potentially communicate with
multiple BBUs. At any time, however, the UE is in communication with,
and under the control of, just one BBU. As the device begins to leave
a cell, it moves into an area of overlap with one or more other
cells. The current BBU senses the weakening signal from the phone and
gives control of the device to whichever base station is receiving the
strongest signal from it. If the device is involved in a call or other
network session at the time, the session must be transferred to the
new base station in what is called a <em>handoff</em>. The decision making
process for handoffs is under the purview of the MME, which has
historically been a proprietary aspect of the cellular equipment
vendors (although open source MME implementations are now starting
to be available).</p>
<p>There have been multiple generations of protocols implementing the
cellular network, colloquially known as 1G, 2G, 3G, and so on. The first
two generations supported only voice, with 3G defining the transition
to broadband access, supporting data rates measured in hundreds of
kilobits-per-second. Today, the industry is at 4G (supporting data rates
typically measured in the few megabits-per-second) and is in the
process of transitioning to 5G (with the promise of a tenfold increase
in data rates).</p>
<p>As of 3G, the generational designation actually corresponds to a
standard defined by the 3GPP (3rd Generation Partnership Project).
Even though its name has &quot;3G&quot; in it, the 3GPP continues to define the
standard for 4G and 5G, each of which corresponds to a release of the
standard. Release 15, which is now published, is considered the
demarcation point between 4G and 5G. By another name, this sequence
of releases and generations is called LTE, which stands for <em>Long-Term
Evolution</em>. The main takeaway is that while standards are published as
a sequence of discrete releases, the industry as a whole is now on a
fairly well-defined evolutionary path known as LTE.</p>
<p>The main innovaition of LTE&apos;s air interface for 5G is the flexibility
it provides. 5G uses a hybrid multiplexing scheme called OFDMA
(Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access), which intuitively
combines frequence-division multiplexing (carving the frequency band
into multiple overlapping sub-channels) and time-division multiplexing
(allocating one or more sub-channels to a given UE for a certain slot
of time). OFDMA also uses a coding scheme known as LDPC (Low Density
Parity Check) that ensures the probability of inter-symbol
interference for transimssions on adjacent sub-channels is zero.
Another way of thinking about LDPC is that the way it encodes bits
onto signals includes enough redundancy (i.e., a form of FEC) to
ensure the receiver is able able recover the original data even when
signals overlap. In addition, BBUs also have the ability to
increase/decrease the power they use to transmit, effectively allowing
them to dynamically change cell size. This makes it possible to move
UEs from one cell to another on the fly.</p>
<p>Taken all together, this gives the RAN three degrees of freedom
(frequency, time, power), which improves its ability to squeeze the
most capacity out of the limited spectrum. More importantly, this
flexibility provides opportunities for ISPs to offer new services to
their subscribers, supporting applications that range from
bandwidth-hungry video and virutual/augmented reality to
latency-sensitive autonomous cars and Internet-of-Things. The
challenge of 5G is how to control and best take advantage of this
flexibility.</p>
