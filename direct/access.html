<h1>2.8 Access Networks<a class="headerlink" href="#access-networks" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>In addition to the Ethernet and Wi-Fi connections we typically use to
connect to the Internet at home, at work, at school, and in many public
spaces, most of us connect to the Internet over an <em>access</em> or
<em>broadband</em> service that we buy from an ISP. This section describes two
such technologies: <em>Passive Optical Networks</em> (PON), commonly referred
to as fiber-to-the-home, and <em>Cellular Networks</em> that connect our mobile
devices. In both cases, the networks are multi-access (like Ethernet and
Wi-Fi), but as we will see, their approach to mediating access is quite
different.</p>
<p>To set a little more context, ISPs (e.g., Telco or Cable companies)
often operate a national backbone, and connected to the periphery of
that backbone are hundreds or thousands of edge sites, each of which
serves a city or neighborhood. These edge sites are commonly called
<em>Central Offices</em> in the Telco world and <em>Head Ends</em> in the cable world,
but despite their names implying “centralized” and “root of the
hierarchy” these sites are at the very edge of the ISP’s network; the
ISP-side of the last-mile that directly connects to customers. PON and
Cellular access networks are anchored in these facilities.<a class="footnote-reference" href="#id2" id="id1">[1]</a></p>

<h2>Passive Optical Network<a class="headerlink" href="#passive-optical-network" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>PON is the technology most commonly used to deliver fiber-based
broadband to homes and businesses. PON adopts a point-to-multipoint
design, which means the network is structured as a tree, with a single
point starting in the ISP’s network and then fanning out to reach up to
1024 homes. PON gets its name from the fact that the splitters are
passive: they forward optical signals downstream and upstream without
actively storing-and-forwarding frames. In this way, they are the
optical variant of repeaters used in the classic Ethernet. Framing then
happens at the source in the ISP’s premises, in a device called an
<em>Optical Line Terminal</em> (OLT), and at the end-points in individual
homes, in a device called an <em>Optical Network Unit</em> (ONU).</p>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="#fig-pon"><span class="std std-numref">Figure 52</span></a> shows an example PON, simplified to
depict just one
ONU and one OLT. In practice, a Central Office would include multiple
OLTs connecting to thousands of customer homes. For completeness,
<a class="reference internal" href="#fig-pon"><span class="std std-numref">Figure 52</span></a> also includes two other details about
how the PON is
connected to the ISP’s backbone (and hence, to the rest of the
Internet). The <em>Agg Switch</em> aggregates traffic from a set of OLTs, and
the <em>BNG</em> (Broadband Network Gateway) is a piece of Telco equipment
that, among many other things, meters Internet traffic for the sake of
billing. As its name implies, the BNG is effectively the gateway between
the access network (everything to the left of the BNG) and the Internet
(everything to the right of the BNG).</p>
<div class="figure align-center" id="id5">
<span id="fig-pon"></span><a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/Slide12.png"><img alt="../_images/Slide12.png" src="../_images/Slide12.png" style="width: 600px;" /></a>
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-number">Figure 52. </span><span class="caption-text">An example PON that connects OLTs in the Central Office
to ONUs in homes and businesses.</span></p>
</div>
<p>Because the splitters are passive, PON has to implement some form of
multi-access protocol. The approach it adopts can be summarized as
follows. First, upstream and downstream traffic are transmitted on two
different optical wavelengths, so they are completely independent of
each other. Downstream traffic starts at the OLT and the signal is
propagated down every link in the PON. As a consequence, every frame
reaches every ONU. This device then looks at a unique identifier in the
individual frames sent over the wavelength, and either keeps the frame
(if the identifier is for it) or drops it (if not). Encryption is used
to keep ONUs from eavesdropping on their neighbors’ traffic.</p>
<p>Upstream traffic is then time-division multiplexed on the upstream
wavelength, with each ONU periodically getting a turn to transmit.
Because the ONUs are distributed over a fairly wide area (measured in
kilometers) and at different distances from the OLT, it is not practical
for them to transmit based on synchronized clocks, as in SONET. Instead,
the ONT transmits <em>grants</em> to the individual ONUs, giving them a time
interval during which they can transmit. In other words, the single OLT
is responsible for centrally implementing the round-robin sharing of the
shared PON. This includes the possibility that the OLT can grant each
ONU a different share of time, effectively implementing different levels
of service.</p>
<p>PON is similar to Ethernet in the sense that it defines a sharing
algorithm that has evolved over time to accommodate higher and higher
bandwidths. G-PON (Gigabit-PON) is the most widely deployed today,
supporting a bandwidth of 2.25-Gbps. XGS-PON (10 Gigabit-PON) is just
now starting to be deployed.</p>

<div class="section" id="cellular-network">
<h2>Cellular Network<a class="headerlink" href="#cellular-network" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>While cellular telephone technology had its roots in analog voice
communication, data services based on cellular standards are now the
norm. Like Wi-Fi, cellular networks transmit data at certain bandwidths
in the radio spectrum. Unlike Wi-Fi, which permits anyone to use a
channel at either 2.4 or 5 GHz (all you have to do is set up a base
station, as many of us do in our homes), exclusive use of various
frequency bands have been auctioned off and licensed to service
providers, who in turn sell mobile access service to their subscribers.</p>
<p>The frequency bands that are used for cellular networks vary around
the world, and are complicated by the fact that ISPs often
simultaneously support both old/legacy technologies and
new/next-generation technologies, each of which occupies a different
frequency band. The high-level summary is that traditional cellular
technologies range from 700-MHz to 2400-MHz, with new mid-spectrum
allocations now happening at 6-GHz and millimeter-wave (mmWave)
allocations opening above 24-GHz.</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="first sidebar-title">Citizens Broadband Radio Service (CBRS)</p>
<p>In addition to the licensed bands, there is also an unlicensed band
at 3.5-GHz set aside in North America, called <em>Citizens Broadband
Radio Service</em> (CBRS), that anyone with a cellular radio can use.
Similar unlicensed bands are being set up in other countries, as
well. This opens the door for setting up private cellular networks,
for example, within a University campus, an enterprise, or a
manufacturing plant.</p>
<p class="last">To be more precise, the CBRS band allows three tiers of users to
share the spectrum: first right of use goes to the original owners of
this spectrum, naval radars and satellite ground stations; followed
by priority users who receive this right over 10MHz bands for three
years via regional auctions; and finally the rest of the population,
who can access and utilize a portion of this band as long as they
first check with a central database of registered users.</p>
</div>
<p>Like 802.11, cellular technology relies on the use of base stations that
are connected to a wired network. In the case of the cellular network,
the base stations are often called <em>Broadband Base Units</em> (BBU), the
mobile devices that connect to them are usually referred to as <em>User
Equipment</em> (UE), and the set of BBUs are anchored at an <em>Evolved Packet
Core</em> (EPC) hosted in a Central Office. The wireless network served by
the EPC is often called a <em>Radio Access Network</em> (RAN).</p>
<p>BBUs officially go by another name—Evolved NodeB, often abbreviated
eNodeB or eNB—where NodeB is what the radio unit was called in an
early incarnation of cellular networks (and has since evolved). Given
that the cellular world continues to evolve at a rapid pace and eNB’s
are soon to be upgraded to gNB’s, we have decided to use the more
generic and less cryptic BBU.</p>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="#fig-ran"><span class="std std-numref">Figure 53</span></a> depicts one possible configuration of
the end-to-end scenario, with a few additional bits of detail. The EPC
has multiple subcomponents, including an MME (Mobility Management
Entity), an HSS (Home Subscriber Server), and an S/PGW (Session/Packet
Gateway) pair; the first tracks and manages the movement of UEs
throughout the RAN, the second is a database that contains
subscriber-related information, and the Gateway pair processes and
forwards packets between the RAN and the Internet (it forms the EPC’s
<em>user plane</em>). We say “one possible configuration” because the
cellular standards allow wide variability in how many S/PGWs a given
MME is responsible for, making is possible for a single MME to manage
mobility across a wide geographic area that is served by multiple
Central Offices. Finally, while not explicitly spelled out in
<a class="reference internal" href="#fig-ran"><span class="std std-numref">Figure 53</span></a>, it is sometimes the case that the ISP’s
PON network is used to connect the remote BBUs back to the Central
Office.</p>

(UEs) to an Evolved Packet Core (EPC) hosted in a Central Office.</span></p>
</div>
<p>The geographic area served by a BBU’s antenna is called a <em>cell</em>. A BBU
could serve a single cell or use multiple directional antennas to serve
multiple cells. Cells don’t have crisp boundaries, and they overlap.
Where they overlap, an UE could potentially communicate with multiple
BBUs. At any time, however, the UE is in communication with, and under
the control of, just one BBU. As the device begins to leave a cell, it
moves into an area of overlap with one or more other cells. The current
BBU senses the weakening signal from the phone and gives control of the
device to whichever base station is receiving the strongest signal from
it. If the device is involved in a call or other network session at the
time, the session must be transferred to the new base station in what is
called a <em>handoff</em>. The decision making process for handoffs is under
the purview of the MME, which has historically been a proprietary aspect
of the cellular equipment vendors (although open source MME
implementations are now starting to be available).</p>
<p>There have been multiple generations of protocols implementing the
cellular network, colloquially known as 1G, 2G, 3G, and so on. The first
two generations supported only voice, with 3G defining the transition to
broadband access, supporting data rates measured in hundreds of
kilobits-per-second. Today, the industry is at 4G (supporting data rates
typically measured in the few megabits-per-second) and is in the process
of transitioning to 5G (with the promise of a tenfold increase in data
rates).</p>
<p>As of 3G, the generational designation actually corresponds to a
standard defined by the 3GPP (3rd Generation Partnership Project). Even
though its name has “3G” in it, the 3GPP continues to define the
standard for 4G and 5G, each of which corresponds to a release of the
standard. Release 15, which is now published, is considered the
demarcation point between 4G and 5G. By another name, this sequence of
releases and generations is called LTE, which stands for <em>Long-Term
Evolution</em>. The main takeaway is that while standards are published as a
sequence of discrete releases, the industry as a whole has been on a
fairly well-defined evolutionary path known as LTE. This section uses
LTE terminology, but highlights the changes coming with 5G when
appropriate.</p>
<p>The main innovation of LTE’s air interface is how it allocates the
available radio spectrum to UEs. Unlike Wi-Fi, which is
contention-based, LTE uses a reservation-based strategy. This difference
is rooted in each system’s fundamental assumption about utilization:
Wi-Fi assumes a lightly loaded network (and hence optimistically
transmits when the wireless link is idle and backs off if contention is
detected), while cellular networks assume (and strive for) high
utilization (and hence explicitly assign different users to different
“shares” of the available radio spectrum).</p>
<p>The state-of-the-art media access mechanism for LTE is called
<em>Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiple Access (OFDMA)</em>. The idea is to
multiplex data over a set of 12 orthogonal subcarrier frequencies, each
of which is modulated independently. The “Multiple Access” in OFDMA
implies that data can simultaneously be sent on behalf of multiple
users, each on a different subcarrier frequency and for a different
duration of time. The subbands are narrow (e.g., 15kHz), but the coding
of user data into OFDMA symbols is designed to minimize the risk of data
loss due to interference between adjacent bands.</p>
<p>The use of OFDMA naturally leads to conceptualizing the radio spectrum
as a two-dimensional resource, as shown in <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-ofdma"><span class="std std-numref">Figure 54</span></a>.  The minimal schedulable unit, called a <em>Resource
Element (RE)</em>, corresponds to a 15kHz-wide band around one subcarrier
frequency and the time it takes to transmit one OFDMA symbol. The
number of bits that can be encoded in each symbol depends on the
modulation rate, so for example using Quadrature Amplitude Modulation
(QAM), 16-QAM yields 4 bits per symbol and 64-QAM yields 6 bits per
symbol.</p>
<div class="figure align-center" id="id7">
<span id="fig-ofdma"></span><a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/Slide4.png"><img alt="../_images/Slide4.png" src="../_images/Slide4.png" style="width: 800px;" /></a>
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-number">Figure 54. </span><span class="caption-text">The available radio spectrum abstractly represented by
a 2-D grid of schedulable Resource Elements.</span></p>
</div>
<p>A scheduler makes allocation decisions at the granularity of blocks of
7x12=84 resource elements, called a <em>Physical Resource Block (PRB)</em>.
<a class="reference internal" href="#fig-ofdma"><span class="std std-numref">Figure 54</span></a> shows two back-to-back PRBs, where UEs are
depicted by different colored blocks. Of course time continues to flow
along one axis, and depending on the size of the licensed frequency
band, there may be many more subcarrier slots (and hence PRBs) available
along the other axis, so the scheduler is essentially scheduling a
sequence of PRBs for transmission.</p>
<p>The 1ms <em>Transmission Time Interval (TTI)</em> shown in <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-ofdma"><span class="std std-numref">Figure
54</span></a> corresponds to the time frame in which the BBU receives
feedback from UEs about the quality of the signal they are experiencing.
This feedback, called a <em>Channel Quality Indicator (CQI)</em>, essentially
reports the observed signal-to-noise ratio, which impacts the UE’s
ability to recover the data bits. The base station then uses this
information to adapt how it allocates the available radio spectrum to
the UEs it is serving.</p>
<p>Up to this point, the description of how we schedule the radio spectrum
is specific to 4G. The transition from 4G to 5G introduces additional
degrees-of-freedom in how the radio spectrum is scheduled, making it
possible to adapt the cellular network to a more diverse set of devices
and applications domains.</p>
<p>Fundamentally, 5G defines a family of waveforms—unlike 4G, which
specified only one waveform—each optimized for a different band in the
radio spectrum.<a class="footnote-reference" href="#id4" id="id3">[2]</a> The bands with carrier frequencies below 1GHz are
designed to deliver mobile broadband and massive IoT services with a
primary focus on range. Carrier frequencies between 1GHz-6GHz are
designed to offer wider bandwidths, focusing on mobile broadband and
mission-critical applications. Carrier frequencies above 24GHz (mmWaves)
are designed to provide super wide bandwidths over short, line-of-sight
coverage.</p>
<table class="docutils footnote" frame="void" id="id4" rules="none">
<colgroup><col class="label" /><col /></colgroup>
<tbody valign="top">
<tr><td class="label"><a class="fn-backref" href="#id3">[2]</a></td><td>A waveform is the frequency, amplitude, and phase-shift
independent property (shape) of a signal. A sine wave is an
example waveform.</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>These different waveforms affect the scheduling and subcarrier intervals
(i.e., the “size” of the Resource Elements just described).</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>For sub-1GHz bands, 5G allows maximum 50MHz bandwidths. In this
case, there are two waveforms: one with subcarrier spacing of 15kHz
and another of 30kHz. (We used 15kHz in the example shown in
<a class="reference internal" href="#fig-ofdma"><span class="std std-numref">Figure 54</span></a>. The corresponding scheduling
intervals are 0.5ms and 0.25ms, respectively. (We used 0.5ms in the
example shown in <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-ofdma"><span class="std std-numref">Figure 54</span></a>.)</li>
<li>For 1GHz-6GHz bands, maximum bandwidths go up to 100MHz.
Correspondingly, there are three waveforms with subcarrier spacings
of 15kHz, 30kHz and 60kHz, corresponding to scheduling intervals of
0.5ms, 0.25ms and 0.125ms, respectively.</li>
<li>For millimeter bands, bandwidths may go up to 400MHz. There are two
waveforms, with subcarrier spacings of 60kHz and 120kHz. Both have
scheduling intervals of 0.125ms.</li>
</ul>
<p>This range of options is important because it adds another degree of
freedom to the scheduler. In addition to allocating resource blocks to
users, it has the ability to dynamically adjust the size of the resource
blocks by changing the wave form being used in the band it is
responsible for scheduling.</p>
<p>Whether 4G or 5G, the scheduling algorithm is a challenging optimization
problem, with the objective of simultaneously (a) maximizing utilization
of the available frequency band, and (b) ensuring that every UE receives
the level of service it requires. This algorithm is not specified by
3GPP, but rather, is the proprietary intellectual property of the BBU
vendors.</p>
