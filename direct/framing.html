<p>Now that we have seen how to transmit a sequence of bits over a
point-to-point link&#x2014;from adaptor to adaptor&#x2014;let&apos;s consider the
scenario in <a href="#host-link">Figure 1</a>. Recall from Chapter 1 that we are
focusing on packet-switched networks, which means that blocks of data
(called <em>frames</em> at this level), not bit streams, are exchanged between
nodes. It is the network adaptor that enables the nodes to exchange
frames. When node A wishes to transmit a frame to node B, it tells its
adaptor to transmit a frame from the node&apos;s memory. This results in a
sequence of bits being sent over the link. The adaptor on node B then
collects together the sequence of bits arriving on the link and deposits
the corresponding frame in B&apos;s memory. Recognizing exactly what set of
bits constitutes a frame&#x2014;that is, determining where the frame begins
and ends&#x2014;is the central challenge faced by the adaptor.</p>

<p>There are several ways to address the framing problem. This section uses
three different protocols to illustrate the various points in the
design space. Note that while we discuss framing in the context of
point-to-point links, the problem is a fundamental one that must also be
addressed in multiple-access networks like Ethernet and Wi-Fi.</p>
<h2 id="byte-oriented-protocols-ppp">Byte-Oriented Protocols (PPP)</h2>
<p>One of the oldest approaches to framing&#x2014;it has its roots in connecting
terminals to mainframes&#x2014;is to view each frame as a collection of bytes
(characters) rather than a collection of bits. Early examples of such
<em>byte-oriented</em> protocols are the Binary Synchronous Communication
(BISYNC) protocol developed by IBM in the late 1960s, and the Digital
Data Communication Message Protocol (DDCMP) used in Digital Equipment
Corporation&apos;s DECNET. (Once upon a time, large computer companaies
like IBM and DEC also built private networks for their customers.)
The widely used Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) is a recent example of
this approach.</p>
<p>At a high level, there are two approaches to byte-oriented framing.
The first is to use special characters known as <em>sentinel characters</em>
to indicate where frames start and end. The idea is to denote the
beginning of a frame by sending a special SYN (synchronization)
character. The data portion of the frame is then sometimes contained
between two more special characters: STX (start of text) and ETX (end
of text). BISYNC used this approach. The problem with the sentinel
approach, of course, is that one of the special characters might
appear in the data portion of the frame. The standard way to overcome
this problem by &quot;escaping&quot; the character by preceding it with a DLE
(data-link-escape) character whenever it appears in the body of a
frame; the DLE character is also escaped (by preceding it with an
extra DLE) in the frame body. (C programmers may notice that this is
analogous to the way a quotation mark is escaped by the backslash when
it occurs inside a string.) This approach is often called <em>character
stuffing</em> because extra characters are inserted in the data portion of
the frame.</p>
<p>The alternative to detecting the end of a frame with a sentinel value 
is to include the number of bytes in the frame at the beginning of the 
frame, in the frame header. DDCMP used this approach. One danger with
this approach is that a transmission error could corrupt the count
field, in which case the end of the frame would not be correctly
detected. (A similar problem exists with the sentinel-based approach
if the ETX field becomes corrupted.) Should this happen, the receiver
will accumulate as many bytes as the bad count field indicates and
then use the error detection field to determine that the frame is
bad. This is sometimes called a <em>framing error</em>. The receiver will
then wait until it sees the next SYN character to start collecting the
bytes that make up the next frame. It is therefore possible that a
framing error will cause back-to-back frames to be incorrectly
received.</p>
<p>The Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP), which is commonly used to
carry Internet Protocol packets over various sorts of point-to-point
links, uses sentinels and character stuffing. The format for a PPP
frame is given in <a href="#ppp">Figure 2</a>.</p>

<p>This figure is the first of many that you will see in this book that are 
used to illustrate frame or packet formats, so a few words of 
explanation are in order. We show a packet as a sequence of labeled 
fields. Above each field is a number indicating the length of that field 
in bits. Note that the packets are transmitted beginning with the 
leftmost field. </p>
<p>The special start-of-text character, denoted as the <code>Flag</code> field
is <code>01111110</code>. The <code>Address</code> and <code>Control</code> fields
usually contain default values and so are uninteresting. The (Protocol)
field is used for demultiplexing; it identifies the high-level protocol,
such as IP. The frame payload size can be negotiated, but it is
1500 bytes by default. The <code>Checksum</code> field is either 2 (by default)
or 4 bytes long.</p>
<p>The PPP frame format is unusual in that several of the field sizes are
negotiated rather than fixed. This negotiation is conducted by a
protocol called the Link Control Protocol (LCP). PPP and LCP work in
tandem: LCP sends control messages encapsulated in PPP frames&#x2014;such
messages are denoted by an LCP identifier in the PPP (Protocol)
field&#x2014;and then turns around and changes PPP&apos;s frame format based on
the information contained in those control messages. LCP is also
involved in establishing a link between two peers when both sides detect
that communication over the link is possible (e.g., when each optical
receiver detects an incoming signal from the fiber to which it
connects).</p>
<h2 id="bit-oriented-protocols-hdlc">Bit-Oriented Protocols (HDLC)</h2>
<p>Unlike byte-oriented protocols, a bit-oriented protocol is not
concerned with byte boundaries&#x2014;it simply views the frame as a
collection of bits. These bits might come from some character set, such
as ASCII; they might be pixel values in an image; or they could be
instructions and operands from an executable file. The Synchronous Data
Link Control (SDLC) protocol developed by IBM is an example of a
bit-oriented protocol; SDLC was later standardized by the ISO as the
High-Level Data Link Control (HDLC) protocol. In the following
discussion, we use HDLC as an example; its frame format is given in
<a href="#hdlc">Figure 3</a>.</p>
<p>HDLC denotes both the beginning and the end of a frame with the
distinguished bit sequence <code>01111110</code>. This sequence is also transmitted
during any times that the link is idle so that the sender and receiver
can keep their clocks synchronized. In this way, both protocols
essentially use the sentinel approach. Because this sequence might
appear anywhere in the body of the frame&#x2014;in fact, the bits <code>01111110</code>
might cross byte boundaries&#x2014;bit-oriented protocols use the analog of
the DLE character, a technique known as <em>bit stuffing</em>.</p>
<figure class="line">
    <a id="hdlc"></a>
    <img src="figures/f02-10-9780123850591.png" width="400px">
    <figcaption>HDLC frame format.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Bit stuffing in the HDLC protocol works as follows. On the sending side,
any time five consecutive 1s have been transmitted from the body of the
message (i.e., excluding when the sender is trying to transmit the
distinguished <code>01111110</code> sequence), the sender inserts a 0 before
transmitting the next bit. On the receiving side, should five
consecutive 1s arrive, the receiver makes its decision based on the next
bit it sees (i.e., the bit following the five 1s). If the next bit is a
0, it must have been stuffed, and so the receiver removes it. If the
next bit is a 1, then one of two things is true: Either this is the
end-of-frame marker or an error has been introduced into the bit stream.
By looking at the <em>next</em> bit, the receiver can distinguish between these
two cases. If it sees a 0 (i.e., the last 8 bits it has looked at are
<code>01111110</code>), then it is the end-of-frame marker; if it sees a 1 (i.e.,
the last 8 bits it has looked at are <code>01111111</code>), then there must have
been an error and the whole frame is discarded. In the latter case, the
receiver has to wait for the next <code>01111110</code> before it can start
receiving again, and, as a consequence, there is the potential that the
receiver will fail to receive two consecutive frames. Obviously, there
are still ways that framing errors can go undetected, such as when an
entire spurious end-of-frame pattern is generated by errors, but these
failures are relatively unlikely. Robust ways of detecting errors are
discussed in a later section.</p>
<p>An interesting characteristic of bit stuffing, as well as character
stuffing, is that the size of a frame is dependent on the data that is
being sent in the payload of the frame. It is in fact not possible to
make all frames exactly the same size, given that the data that might be
carried in any frame is arbitrary. (To convince yourself of this,
consider what happens if the last byte of a frame&apos;s body is the ETX
character.) A form of framing that ensures that all frames are the same
size is described in the next subsection.</p>
<h2 id="clock-based-framing-sonet">Clock-Based Framing (SONET)</h2>
<p>A third approach to framing is exemplified by the Synchronous Optical
Network (SONET) standard. For lack of a widely accepted generic term, we
refer to this approach simply as <em>clock-based framing</em>. SONET was first
proposed by Bell Communications Research (Bellcore), and then developed
under the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) for digital
transmission over optical fiber; it has since been adopted by the ITU-T.
SONET has been for many years the dominant standard for long-distance
transmission of data over optical networks.</p>
<p>An important point to make about SONET before we go any further is that
the full specification is substantially larger than this book. Thus, the
following discussion will necessarily cover only the high points of the
standard. Also, SONET addresses both the framing problem and the
encoding problem. It also addresses a problem that is very important for
phone companies&#x2014;the multiplexing of several low-speed links onto one
high-speed link. (In fact, much of SONET&apos;s design reflects the fact that
phone companies have to be concerned with multiplexing large numbers
of the 64-kbps channels that traditionally are used for telephone calls.)
We begin with SONET&apos;s approach to framing and discuss the other issues
following.</p>
<p>As with the previously discussed framing schemes, a SONET frame has some
special information that tells the receiver where the frame starts and
ends; however, that is about as far as the similarities go. Notably, no
bit stuffing is used, so that a frame&apos;s length does not depend on the
data being sent. So the question to ask is &quot;How does the receiver know
where each frame starts and ends?&quot; We consider this question for the
lowest-speed SONET link, which is known as STS-1 and runs at 51.84 Mbps.
An STS-1 frame is shown in <a href="#sonet-frame">Figure 4</a>. It is arranged as
9 rows of 90 bytes each, and the first 3 bytes of each row are overhead,
with the rest being available for data that is being transmitted over
the link. The first 2 bytes of the frame contain a special bit pattern,
and it is these bytes that enable the receiver to determine where the
frame starts. However, since bit stuffing is not used, there is no
reason why this pattern will not occasionally turn up in the payload
portion of the frame. To guard against this, the receiver looks for the
special bit pattern consistently, hoping to see it appearing once every
810 bytes, since each frame is 9 <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math><semantics><mrow><mo>&#xD7;</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\times</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="strut" style="height:0.58333em;"></span><span class="strut bottom" style="height:0.66666em;vertical-align:-0.08333em;"></span><span class="base textstyle uncramped"><span class="mord">&#xD7;</span></span></span></span> 90 = 810 bytes long. When the
special pattern turns up in the right place enough times, the receiver
concludes that it is in sync and can then interpret the frame correctly.</p>
<figure class="line">
    <a id="sonet-frame"></a>
    <img src="figures/f02-11-9780123850591.png" width="500px">
    <figcaption>A SONET STS-1 frame.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>One of the things we are not describing due to the complexity of SONET
is the detailed use of all the other overhead bytes. Part of this
complexity can be attributed to the fact that SONET runs across the
carrier&apos;s optical network, not just over a single link. (Recall that we
are glossing over the fact that the carriers implement a network, and we
are instead focusing on the fact that we can lease a SONET link from
them and then use this link to build our own packet-switched network.)
Additional complexity comes from the fact that SONET provides a
considerably richer set of services than just data transfer. For
example, 64 kbps of a SONET link&apos;s capacity is set aside for a voice
channel that is used for maintenance.</p>
<p>The overhead bytes of a SONET frame are encoded using NRZ, the simple
encoding described in the previous section where 1s are high and 0s are
low. However, to ensure that there are plenty of transitions to allow
the receiver to recover the sender&apos;s clock, the payload bytes are
<em>scrambled</em>. This is done by calculating the exclusive OR (XOR) of the
data to be transmitted and by the use of a well-known bit pattern. The
bit pattern, which is 127 bits long, has plenty of transitions from 1 to
0, so that XORing it with the transmitted data is likely to yield a
signal with enough transitions to enable clock recovery.</p>
<p>SONET supports the multiplexing of multiple low-speed links in the
following way. A given SONET link runs at one of a finite set of
possible rates, ranging from 51.84 Mbps (STS-1) to 39,813,120 Mbps
(STS-786). Note that all of these rates are integer multiples of STS-1.
The significance for framing is that a single SONET frame can contain
subframes for multiple lower-rate channels. A second related feature
is that each frame is 125 <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math><semantics><mrow><mi>&#x3BC;</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mu</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="strut" style="height:0.43056em;"></span><span class="strut bottom" style="height:0.625em;vertical-align:-0.19444em;"></span><span class="base textstyle uncramped"><span class="mord mathit">&#x3BC;</span></span></span></span>s long. This means that at STS-1
rates, a SONET frame is 810 bytes long, while at STS-3 rates, each SONET
frame is 2430 bytes long. Notice the synergy between these two features:
3 <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math><semantics><mrow><mo>&#xD7;</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\times</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="strut" style="height:0.58333em;"></span><span class="strut bottom" style="height:0.66666em;vertical-align:-0.08333em;"></span><span class="base textstyle uncramped"><span class="mord">&#xD7;</span></span></span></span> 810 = 2430, meaning that three STS-1 frames fit exactly
in a single STS-3 frame.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>STS stands for <em>Synchronous Transport Signal</em>, which is how SONET 
talks about frames. There is a parallel term&#x2014;<em>Optical Carrier</em>
(OC)&#x2014;that is used to talk about the underlying optical signal that
carries SONET frames. We say these two terms are parallel because
STS-3 and OC-3, to use a concrete example, both imply a transmission
rate of 155.52 Mbps. Since we&apos;re focused on framing here, we will
stick with STS, but it is more likely that you will hear someone
refer to an optical link by its &quot;OC&quot; name.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Intuitively, the STS-N frame can be thought of as consisting of N
STS-1 frames, where the bytes from these frames are interleaved; that
is, a byte from the first frame is transmitted, then a byte from the
second frame is transmitted, and so on. The reason for interleaving the
bytes from each STS-N frame is to ensure that the bytes in each STS-1
frame are evenly paced; that is, bytes show up at the receiver at a
smooth 51 Mbps, rather than all bunched up during one particular
1/N<span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math><semantics><mrow><msup><mrow></mrow><mrow><mi>t</mi><mi>h</mi></mrow></msup></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">^{th}</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="strut" style="height:0.849108em;"></span><span class="strut bottom" style="height:0.849108em;vertical-align:0em;"></span><span class="base textstyle uncramped"><span class="mord"><span></span><span class="msupsub"><span class="vlist"><span style="top:-0.363em;margin-right:0.05em;"><span class="fontsize-ensurer reset-size5 size5"><span style="font-size:0em;">&#x200B;</span></span><span class="reset-textstyle scriptstyle uncramped mtight"><span class="mord scriptstyle uncramped mtight"><span class="mord mathit mtight">t</span><span class="mord mathit mtight">h</span></span></span></span><span class="baseline-fix"><span class="fontsize-ensurer reset-size5 size5"><span style="font-size:0em;">&#x200B;</span></span>&#x200B;</span></span></span></span></span></span></span> of the 125-<span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math><semantics><mrow><mi>&#x3BC;</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mu</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="strut" style="height:0.43056em;"></span><span class="strut bottom" style="height:0.625em;vertical-align:-0.19444em;"></span><span class="base textstyle uncramped"><span class="mord mathit">&#x3BC;</span></span></span></span>s interval.</p>

    <figcaption>Three STS-1 frames multiplexed onto one STS-3c
    frame.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Although it is accurate to view an STS-N signal as being used to
multiplex N STS-1 frames, the payload from these STS-1 frames can be
linked together to form a larger STS-N payload; such a link is denoted
STS-Nc (for <em>concatenated</em>). One of the fields in the overhead is used
for this purpose. <a href="#sonet1">Figure 5</a> schematically depicts
concatenation in the case of three STS-1 frames being concatenated into
a single STS-3c frame. The significance of a SONET link being designated
as STS-3c rather than STS-3 is that, in the former case, the user of the
link can view it as a single 155.25-Mbps pipe, whereas an STS-3 should
really be viewed as three 51.84-Mbps links that happen to share a fiber.</p>

    <figcaption>SONET frames out of phase.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Finally, the preceding description of SONET is overly simplistic in that
it assumes that the payload for each frame is completely contained
within the frame. (Why wouldn&apos;t it be?) In fact, we should view the
STS-1 frame just described as simply a placeholder for the frame, where
the actual payload may <em>float</em> across frame boundaries. This situation
is illustrated in <a href="#sonet3">Figure 6</a>. Here we see both the STS-1
payload floating across two STS-1 frames and the payload shifted some
number of bytes to the right and, therefore, wrapped around. One of the
fields in the frame overhead points to the beginning of the payload. The
value of this capability is that it simplifies the task of synchronizing
the clocks used throughout the carriers&apos; networks, which is something
that carriers spend a lot of their time worrying about.</p>
