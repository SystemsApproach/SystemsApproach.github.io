<h1>2.2 Encoding<a class="headerlink" href="#encoding" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>The first step in turning nodes and links into usable building blocks is
to understand how to connect them in such a way that bits can be
transmitted from one node to the other. As mentioned in the preceding
section, signals propagate over physical links. The task, therefore, is
to encode the binary data that the source node wants to send into the
signals that the links are able to carry and then to decode the signal
back into the corresponding binary data at the receiving node. We ignore
the details of modulation and assume we are working with two discrete
signals: high and low. In practice, these signals might correspond to
two different voltages on a copper-based link, two different power
levels on an optical link, or two different amplitudes on a radio
transmission.</p>
<p>Most of the functions discussed in this chapter are performed by a
<em>network adaptor</em>—a piece of hardware that connects a node to a link.
The network adaptor contains a signalling component that actually
encodes bits into signals at the sending node and decodes signals into
bits at the receiving node. Thus, as illustrated in <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-node-link-1"><span class="std std-numref">Figure
23</span></a>, signals travel over a link between two signalling
components, and bits flow between network adaptors.</p>
<div class="figure align-center" id="id1">

<p class="caption"><span class="caption-number">Figure 23. </span><span class="caption-text">Signals travel between signalling components; bits

</div>
<p>Let’s return to the problem of encoding bits onto signals. The obvious
thing to do is to map the data value&nbsp;1 onto the high signal and the
data value&nbsp;0 onto the low signal. This is exactly the mapping used by
an encoding scheme called, cryptically enough, <em>non-return to zero</em>
(NRZ).  For example, <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-nrz"><span class="std std-numref">Figure 24</span></a> schematically
depicts the NRZ-encoded signal (bottom) that corresponds to the
transmission of a particular sequence of bits (top).</p>
<div class="figure align-center" id="id2">
<span id="fig-nrz"></span><a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/f02-04-9780123850591.png"><img alt="../_images/f02-04-9780123850591.png" src="../_images/f02-04-9780123850591.png" style="width: 400px;" /></a>
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-number">Figure 24. </span><span class="caption-text">NRZ encoding of a bit stream.</span></p>
</div>
<p>The problem with NRZ is that a sequence of several consecutive 1s means
that the signal stays high on the link for an extended period of time;
similarly, several consecutive 0s means that the signal stays low for a
long time. There are two fundamental problems caused by long strings of
1s or 0s. The first is that it leads to a situation known as <em>baseline
wander</em>. Specifically, the receiver keeps an average of the signal it
has seen so far and then uses this average to distinguish between low
and high signals. Whenever the signal is significantly lower than this
average, the receiver concludes that it has just seen a&nbsp;0; likewise, a
signal that is significantly higher than the average is interpreted to
be a&nbsp;1. The problem, of course, is that too many consecutive 1s or 0s
cause this average to change, making it more difficult to detect a
significant change in the signal.</p>
<p>The second problem is that frequent transitions from high to low and
<em>vice versa</em> are necessary to enable <em>clock recovery</em>. Intuitively, the
clock recovery problem is that both the encoding and decoding processes
are driven by a clock—every clock cycle the sender transmits a bit and
the receiver recovers a bit. The sender’s and the receiver’s clocks have
to be precisely synchronized in order for the receiver to recover the
same bits the sender transmits. If the receiver’s clock is even slightly
faster or slower than the sender’s clock, then it does not correctly
decode the signal. You could imagine sending the clock to the receiver
over a separate wire, but this is typically avoided because it makes the
cost of cabling twice as high. So, instead, the receiver derives the
clock from the received signal—the clock recovery process. Whenever the
signal changes, such as on a transition from 1 to 0 or from 0 to 1, then
the receiver knows it is at a clock cycle boundary, and it can
resynchronize itself. However, a long period of time without such a
transition leads to clock drift. Thus, clock recovery depends on having
lots of transitions in the signal, no matter what data is being sent.</p>
<p>One approach that addresses this problem, called <em>non-return to zero
inverted</em> (NRZI), has the sender make a transition from the current
signal to encode a 1 and stay at the current signal to encode
a 0. This solves the problem of consecutive 1s, but obviously does
nothing for consecutive 0s. NRZI is illustrated in <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-encode-all"><span class="std std-numref">Figure 25</span></a>. An alternative, called <em>Manchester encoding</em>, does
a more explicit job of merging the clock with the signal by
transmitting the exclusive OR of the NRZ-encoded data and the
clock. (Think of the local clock as an internal signal that alternates
from low to high; a low/high pair is considered one clock cycle.) The
Manchester encoding is also illustrated in <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-encode-all"><span class="std std-numref">Figure 25</span></a>. Observe that the Manchester encoding results in 0
being encoded as a low-to-high transition and 1 being encoded as a
high-to-low transition. Because both 0s and 1s result in a transition
to the signal, the clock can be effectively recovered at the
receiver. (There is also a variant of the Manchester encoding, called
<em>Differential Manchester</em>, in which a 1 is encoded with the first half
of the signal equal to the last half of the previous bit’s signal and
a 0 is encoded with the first half of the signal opposite to the last
half of the previous bit’s signal.)</p>
<div class="figure align-center" id="id3">
<span id="fig-encode-all"></span><a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/f02-05-9780123850591.png"><img alt="../_images/f02-05-9780123850591.png" src="../_images/f02-05-9780123850591.png" style="width: 400px;" /></a>
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-number">Figure 25. </span><span class="caption-text">Different encoding strategies.</span></p>
</div>
<p>The problem with the Manchester encoding scheme is that it doubles the
rate at which signal transitions are made on the link, which means that
the receiver has half the time to detect each pulse of the signal. The
rate at which the signal changes is called the link’s <em>baud rate</em>. In
the case of the Manchester encoding, the bit rate is half the baud rate,
so the encoding is considered only 50% efficient. Keep in mind that if
the receiver had been able to keep up with the faster baud rate required
by the Manchester encoding in <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-encode-all"><span class="std std-numref">Figure 25</span></a>, then
both NRZ and NRZI could have been able to transmit twice as many bits
in the same time period.</p>
<p>Note that bit rate isn’t necessarily less than or equal to the baud
rate, as the Manchester encoding suggests. If the modulation scheme is
able to utilize (and recognize) four different signals, as opposed to
just two (e.g., “high” and “low”), then it is possible to encode two bits
into each clock interval, resulting in a bit rate that is twice the baud
rate. Similarly, being able to modulate among eight different signals
means being able to transmit three bits per clock interval. In
general, it is important to keep in mind we have over-simplified
modulation, which is much more sophisticated than transmitting
“high” and “low” signals. It is not uncommon to vary a combination
of a signal’s phase and amplitude, making it possible to encode
16 or even 64 different patterns (often dalled <em>symbols</em>) during each
clock interval. <em>QAM (Quadrature Amplitude Modulation)</em> is widely used
example of such a modulation scheme.</p>
<p>A final encoding that we consider, called <em>4B/5B</em>, attempts to address
the inefficiency of the Manchester encoding without suffering from the
problem of having extended durations of high or low signals. The idea of
4B/5B is to insert extra bits into the bit stream so as to break up long
sequences of 0s or 1s. Specifically, every 4&nbsp;bits of actual data are
encoded in a 5-bit code that is then transmitted to the receiver; hence,
the name 4B/5B. The 5-bit codes are selected in such a way that each one
has no more than one leading 0 and no more than two trailing 0s. Thus,
when sent back-to-back, no pair of 5-bit codes results in more than
three consecutive 0s being transmitted. The resulting 5-bit codes are
then transmitted using the NRZI encoding, which explains why the code is
only concerned about consecutive 0s—NRZI already solves the problem of
consecutive 1s. Note that the 4B/5B encoding results in 80% efficiency.</p>

<p><a class="reference internal" href="#tab-4b5b"><span class="std std-numref">Table 3</span></a> gives the 5-bit codes that correspond
to each of the
16 possible 4-bit data symbols. Notice that since 5&nbsp;bits are enough to
encode 32 different codes, and we are using only 16 of these for data,
there are 16 codes left over that we can use for other purposes. Of
these, code <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">11111</span></code> is used when the line is idle, code <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">00000</span></code>
corresponds to when the line is dead, and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">00100</span></code> is interpreted to
mean halt. Of the remaining 13&nbsp;codes, 7 of them are not valid because
they violate the “one leading&nbsp;0, two trailing&nbsp;0s,” rule, and the other 6
represent various control symbols. Some of the framing protocols
described later in this chapter make use of these control symbols.</p>
