<h1>2.7 Wireless Networks<a class="headerlink" href="#wireless-networks" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Wireless technologies differ from wired links in some important ways,
while at the same time sharing many common properties. Like wired links,
issues of bit errors are of great concern—typically even more so due to
the unpredictable noise environment of most wireless links. Framing and
reliability also have to be addressed. Unlike wired links, power is a
big issue for wireless, especially because wireless links are often used
by small mobile devices (like phones and sensors) that have limited
access to power (e.g., a small battery). Furthermore, you can’t go
blasting away at arbitrarily high power with a radio transmitter—there
are concerns about interference with other devices and usually
regulations about how much power a device may emit at any given
frequency.</p>
<p>Wireless media are also inherently multi-access; it’s difficult to
direct your radio transmission to just a single receiver or to avoid
receiving radio signals from any transmitter with enough power in your
neighborhood. Hence, media access control is a central issue for
wireless links. And, because it’s hard to control who receives your
signal when you transmit over the air, issues of eavesdropping may also
have to be addressed.</p>
<p>There is a baffling assortment of different wireless technologies, each
of which makes different tradeoffs in various dimensions. One simple way
to categorize the different technologies is by the data rates they
provide and how far apart communicating nodes can be. Other important
differences include which part of the electromagnetic spectrum they use
(including whether it requires a license) and how much power they
consume. In this section, we discuss two prominent wireless
technologies: Wi-Fi (more formally known as 802.11), and Bluetooth. The
next section discusses cellular networks in the context of ISP access
services. <a class="reference internal" href="#tab-wireless-tech"><span class="std std-numref">Table 4</span></a> gives an overview of
these technologies and how they compare to each other.</p>

<p>You may recall that bandwidth sometimes means the width of a frequency
band in hertz and sometimes the data rate of a link. Because both these
concepts come up in discussions of wireless networks, we’re going to use
<em>bandwidth</em> here in its stricter sense—width of a frequency band—and use
the term <em>data rate</em> to describe the number of bits per second that can
be sent over the link, as in <a class="reference internal" href="#tab-wireless-tech"><span class="std std-numref">Table 4</span></a>.</p>
<div class="section" id="basic-issues">
<h2>Basic Issues<a class="headerlink" href="#basic-issues" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Because wireless links all share the same medium, the challenge is to
share that medium efficiently, without unduly interfering with each
other. Most of this sharing is accomplished by dividing it up along the
dimensions of frequency and space. Exclusive use of a particular
frequency in a particular geographic area may be allocated to an
individual entity such as a corporation. It is feasible to limit the
area covered by an electromagnetic signal because such signals weaken,
or <em>attenuate</em>, with the distance from their origin. To reduce the area
covered by your signal, reduce the power of your transmitter.</p>
<p>These allocations are typically determined by government agencies, such
as the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in the United States.
Specific bands (frequency ranges) are allocated to certain uses. Some
bands are reserved for government use. Other bands are reserved for uses
such as AM radio, FM radio, television, satellite communication, and
cellular phones. Specific frequencies within these bands are then
licensed to individual organizations for use within certain geographical
areas. Finally, several frequency bands are set aside for license-exempt
usage—bands in which a license is not needed.</p>
<p>Devices that use license-exempt frequencies are still subject to certain
restrictions to make that otherwise unconstrained sharing work. Most
important of these is a limit on transmission power. This limits the
range of a signal, making it less likely to interfere with another
signal. For example, a cordless phone (a common unlicensed device) might
have a range of about 100 feet.</p>
<p>One idea that shows up a lot when spectrum is shared among many devices
and applications is <em>spread spectrum</em>. The idea behind spread spectrum
is to spread the signal over a wider frequency band, so as to minimize
the impact of interference from other devices. (Spread spectrum was
originally designed for military use, so these “other devices” were
often attempting to jam the signal.) For example, <em>frequency hopping</em> is
a spread spectrum technique that involves transmitting the signal over a
random sequence of frequencies; that is, first transmitting at one
frequency, then a second, then a third, and so on. The sequence of
frequencies is not truly random but is instead computed algorithmically
by a pseudorandom number generator. The receiver uses the same algorithm
as the sender and initializes it with the same seed; hence, it is able
to hop frequencies in sync with the transmitter to correctly receive the
frame. This scheme reduces interference by making it unlikely that two
signals would be using the same frequency for more than the infrequent
isolated bit.</p>
<p>A second spread spectrum technique, called <em>direct sequence</em>, adds
redundancy for greater tolerance of interference. Each bit of data is
represented by multiple bits in the transmitted signal so that, if
some of the transmitted bits are damaged by interference, there is
usually enough redundancy to recover the original bit. For each bit
the sender wants to transmit, it actually sends the exclusive-OR of
that bit and n random bits. As with frequency hopping, the sequence of
random bits is generated by a pseudorandom number generator known to
both the sender and the receiver. The transmitted values, known as an
n-bit <em>chipping code</em>, spread the signal across a frequency band that
is n times wider than the frame would have otherwise
required. <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-chipping"><span class="std std-numref">Figure 43</span></a> gives an example of a
4-bit chipping sequence.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="caption-number">Figure 43. </span><span class="caption-text">Example&nbsp;4-bit chipping sequence.</span></p>
</div>
<p>Different parts of the electromagnetic spectrum have different
properties, making some better suited to communication, and some less
so. For example, some can penetrate buildings and some cannot.
Governments regulate only the prime communication portion: the radio and
microwave ranges. As demand for prime spectrum increases, there is great
interest in the spectrum that is becoming available as analog television
is phased out in favor of digital.</p>
<p>In many wireless networks today we observe that there are two
different classes of endpoints. One endpoint, sometimes described as
the <em>base station</em>, usually has no mobility but has a wired (or at
least high-bandwidth) connection to the Internet or other networks, as
shown in <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-wirelessbasestation"><span class="std std-numref">Figure 44</span></a>. The node at
the other end of the link—shown here as a client node—is often mobile
and relies on its link to the base station for all of its
communication with other nodes.</p>
<p>Observe that in <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-wirelessbasestation"><span class="std std-numref">Figure 44</span></a> we have
used a wavy pair of lines to represent the wireless “link” abstraction
provided between two devices (e.g., between a base station and one of
its client nodes). One of the interesting aspects of wireless
communication is that it naturally supports point-to-multipoint
communication, because radio waves sent by one device can be
simultaneously received by many devices.  However, it is often useful
to create a point-to-point link abstraction for higher layer
protocols, and we will see examples of how this works later in this
section.</p>
<p>Note that in <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-wirelessbasestation"><span class="std std-numref">Figure 44</span></a>
communication between non-base (client) nodes is routed via the base
station. This is in spite of the fact that radio waves emitted by one
client node may well be received by other client nodes—the common base
station model does not permit direct communication between the client
nodes.</p>

<p>This topology implies three qualitatively different levels of mobility.
The first level is no mobility, such as when a receiver must be in a
fixed location to receive a directional transmission from the base
station. The second level is mobility within the range of a base, as is
the case with Bluetooth. The third level is mobility between bases, as
is the case with cell phones and Wi-Fi.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="caption-number">Figure 45. </span><span class="caption-text">A wireless ad hoc or mesh network.</span></p>
</div>
<p>An alternative topology that is seeing increasing interest is the
<em>mesh</em> or <em>ad hoc</em> network. In a wireless mesh, nodes are peers; that
is, there is no special base station node. Messages may be forwarded
via a chain of peer nodes as long as each node is within range of the
preceding node. This is illustrated in <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-wirelessmesh"><span class="std std-numref">Figure 45</span></a>. This allows the wireless portion of a network to
extend beyond the limited range of a single radio. From the point of
view of competition between technologies, this allows a shorter-range
technology to extend its range and potentially compete with a
longer-range technology. Meshes also offer fault tolerance by
providing multiple routes for a message to get from point A to
point B. A mesh network can be extended incrementally, with
incremental costs. On the other hand, a mesh network requires non-base
nodes to have a certain level of sophistication in their hardware and
software, potentially increasing per-unit costs and power consumption,
a critical consideration for battery-powered devices.  Wireless mesh
networks are of considerable research interest, but they are still in
their relative infancy compared to networks with base
stations. Wireless sensor networks, another hot emerging technology,
often form wireless meshes.</p>
<p>Now that we have covered some of the common wireless issues, let’s take
a look at the details of two common wireless technologies.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="wi-fi">
<h2>802.11/Wi-Fi<a class="headerlink" href="#wi-fi" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Most readers will have used a wireless network based on the IEEE 802.11
standards, often referred to as <em>Wi-Fi</em>. Wi-Fi is technically a
trademark, owned by a trade group called the Wi-Fi Alliance, which
certifies product compliance with 802.11. Like Ethernet, 802.11 is
designed for use in a limited geographical area (homes, office
buildings, campuses), and its primary challenge is to mediate access to
a shared communication medium—in this case, signals propagating through
space.</p>
<div class="section" id="physical-properties">
<h3>Physical Properties<a class="headerlink" href="#physical-properties" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>802.11 defines a number of different physical layers that operate in
various frequency bands and provide a range of different data rates.</p>
<p>The original 802.11 standard defined two radio-based physical layers
standards, one using frequency hopping (over 79 1-MHz-wide frequency
bandwidths) and the other using direct sequence spread spectrum (with
an 11-bit chipping sequence). Both provided data rates in the 2&nbsp;Mbps
range.  Subsequently, the physical layer standard 802.11b was added,
and using a variant of direct sequence, supported up to 11&nbsp;Mbps. These
three standards all operated in the license-exempt 2.4-GHz frequency
band of the electromagnetic spectrum. Then came 802.11a, which
delivered up to 54&nbsp;Mbps using a variant of frequency division
multiplexing called <em>orthogonal frequency division multiplexing
(OFDM)</em>. 802.11a runs in the license-exempt 5-GHz band.  802.11g
followed, and also using OFDM, delivered up to 54&nbsp;Mbps. 802.11g is
backward compatible with 802.11b (and returns to the 2.4-GHz band).</p>
<p>At the time of writing, many devices support 802.11n or 802.11ac,
which typically achieve per-device data rates of 150 Mbps to 450 Mbps,
respectively. This improvement is partly due to the use of multiple
antennas and allowing greater wireless channel bandwidths. The use of
multiple antennas is often called <em>MIMO</em> for multiple-input,
multiple-output. The latest emerging standard, 802.11ax, promises
another substantial improvement in throughput, in part by adopting
many of the coding and modulation techniques used in the 4G/5G
cellular network, which we describe in the next section.</p>
<p>It is common for commercial products to support more than one flavor of
802.11; many base stations support all five variants (a,b, g, n, and ac).
This not only ensures compatibility with any device that supports any
one of the standards but also makes it possible for two such products to
choose the highest bandwidth option for a particular environment.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that while all the 802.11 standards define a
<em>maximum</em> bit rate that can be supported, they mostly support lower bit
rates as well (e.g., 802.11a allows for bit rates of 6, 9, 12,
18, 24, 36, 48, and 54 Mbps). At lower bit rates, it is easier to decode
transmitted signals in the presence of noise. Different modulation
schemes are used to achieve the various bit rates. In addition, the
amount of redundant information in the form of error-correcting codes is
varied. More redundant information means higher resilience to bit errors
at the cost of lowering the effective data rate (since more of the
transmitted bits are redundant).</p>
<p>The systems try to pick an optimal bit rate based on the noise
environment in which they find themselves; the algorithms for bit rate
selection can be quite complex. Interestingly, the 802.11 standards do
not specify a particular approach but leave the algorithms to the
various vendors. The basic approach to picking a bit rate is to estimate
the bit error rate either by directly measuring the signal-to-noise
ratio (SNR) at the physical layer or by estimating the SNR by measuring
how often packets are successfully transmitted and acknowledged. In some
approaches, a sender will occasionally probe a higher bit rate by
sending one or more packets at that rate to see if it succeeds.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="collision-avoidance">
<h3>Collision Avoidance<a class="headerlink" href="#collision-avoidance" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>At first glance, it might seem that a wireless protocol would follow the
same algorithm as the Ethernet—wait until the link becomes idle before
transmitting and back off should a collision occur—and, to a first
approximation, this is what 802.11 does. The additional complication for
wireless is that, while a node on an Ethernet receives every other
node’s transmissions and can transmit and receive at the same time,
neither of these conditions holds for wireless nodes. This makes
detection of collisions rather more complex. The reason why wireless
nodes cannot usually transmit and receive at the same time (on the same
frequency) is that the power generated by the transmitter is much higher
than any received is likely to be and so swamps the receiving circuitry.
The reason why a node may not receive transmissions from another node is
because that node may be too far away or blocked by an obstacle. This
situation is a bit more complex than it first appears, as the following
discussion will illustrate.</p>

<p>Consider the situation depicted in <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-wifihiddennode"><span class="std std-numref">Figure 46</span></a>,
where A and C are both within range of B but not each other. Suppose both A
and C want to communicate with B and so they each send it a frame. A and
C are unaware of each other since their signals do not carry that far.
These two frames collide with each other at B, but unlike an Ethernet,
neither A nor C is aware of this collision. A and C are said to be
<em>hidden nodes</em> with respect to each other.</p>

</div>
<p>A related problem, called the <em>exposed node problem</em>, occurs under the
circumstances illustrated in <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-wifiexposednode"><span class="std std-numref">Figure 47</span></a>,
where each
of the four nodes is able to send and receive signals that reach just
the nodes to its immediate left and right. For example, B can exchange
frames with A and C but it cannot reach D, while C can reach B and D but
not A. Suppose B is sending to A. Node C is aware of this communication
because it hears B’s transmission. It would be a mistake, however, for C
to conclude that it cannot transmit to anyone just because it can hear
B’s transmission. For example, suppose C wants to transmit to node D.
This is not a problem since C’s transmission to D will not interfere
with A’s ability to receive from B. (It would interfere with A sending
to B, but B is transmitting in our example.)</p>
<p>802.11 addresses these problems by using CSMA/CA, where the CA stands
for collision <em>avoidance</em>, in contrast to the collision <em>detection</em> of
CSMA/CD used on Ethernets. There are a few pieces to make this work.</p>
<p>The Carrier Sense part seems simple enough: Before sending a packet, the
transmitter checks if it can hear any other transmissions; if not, it
sends. However, because of the hidden node problem, just waiting for the
absence of signals from other transmitters does not guarantee that a
collision will not occur from the perspective of the receiver. For this
reason, one part of CSMA/CA is an explicit ACK from the receiver to the
sender. If the packet was successfully decoded and passed its CRC at the
receiver, the receiver sends an ACK back to the sender.</p>
<p>Note that if a collision does occur, it will render the entire packet
useless. For this reason, 802.11 adds an optional mechanism called
RTS-CTS (Ready to Send-Clear to Send). This goes some way toward
addressing the hidden node problem. The sender sends an RTS—a short
packet—to the intended receiver, and if that packet is received
successfully the receiver responds with another short packet, the CTS.
Even though the RTS may not have been heard by a hidden node, the CTS
probably will be. This effectively tells the nodes within range of the
receiver that they should not send anything for a while—the amount of
time of the intended transmission is included in the RTS and CTS
packets. After that time plus a small interval has passed, the carrier
can be assumed to be available again, and another node is free to try to
send.</p>
<p>Of course, two nodes might detect an idle link and try to transmit an
RTS frame at the same time, causing their RTS frames to collide with
each other. The senders realize the collision has happened when they do
not receive the CTS frame after a period of time, in which case they
each wait a random amount of time before trying again. The amount of
time a given node delays is defined by an exponential backoff algorithm
very much like that used on the Ethernet.</p>
<p>After a successful RTS-CTS exchange, the sender sends its data packet
and, if all goes well, receives an ACK for that packet. In the absence
of a timely ACK, the sender will try again to request usage of the
channel again, using the same process described above. By this time, of
course, other nodes may again be trying to get access to the channel as
well.</p>

<h3>Distribution System<a class="headerlink" href="#distribution-system" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>As described so far, 802.11 would be suitable for a network with a mesh
(<em>ad hoc</em>) topology, and development of an 802.11s standard for mesh
networks is nearing completion. At the current time, however, nearly all
802.11 networks use a base-station-oriented topology.</p>
<p>Instead of all nodes being created equal, some nodes are allowed to
roam (e.g., your laptop) and some are connected to a wired network
infrastructure. 802.11 calls these base stations <em>access points</em>
(APs), and they are connected to each other by a so-called
<em>distribution system</em>. <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-wireless2"><span class="std std-numref">Figure 48</span></a> illustrates
a distribution system that connects three access points, each of which
services the nodes in some region. Each access point operates on some
channel in the appropriate frequency range, and each AP will typically
be on a different channel than its neighbors.</p>
<div class="figure align-center" id="id7">
<span id="fig-wireless2"></span><a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/f02-32-9780123850591.png"><img alt="../_images/f02-32-9780123850591.png" src="../_images/f02-32-9780123850591.png" style="width: 500px;" /></a>
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-number">Figure 48. </span><span class="caption-text">Access points connected to a distribution system.</span></p>
</div>
<p>The details of the distribution system are not important to this
discussion—it could be an Ethernet, for example. The only important
point is that the distribution network operates at the link layer, the
same protocol layer as the wireless links. In other words, it does not
depend on any higher-level protocols (such as the network layer).</p>
<p>Although two nodes can communicate directly with each other if they are
within reach of each other, the idea behind this configuration is that
each node associates itself with one access point. For node A to
communicate with node E, for example, A first sends a frame to its
access point (AP-1), which forwards the frame across the distribution
system to AP-3, which finally transmits the frame to E. How AP-1 knew to
forward the message to AP-3 is beyond the scope of 802.11; it may have
used a bridging protocol. What 802.11 does specify is how nodes select
their access points and, more interestingly, how this algorithm works in
light of nodes moving from one cell to another.</p>
<p>The technique for selecting an AP is called <em>scanning</em> and involves the
following four steps:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>The node sends a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Probe</span></code> frame.</li>
<li>All APs within reach reply with a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Probe</span> <span class="pre">Response</span></code> frame.</li>
<li>The node selects one of the access points and sends that AP an
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Association</span> <span class="pre">Request</span></code> frame.</li>
<li>The AP replies with an <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Association</span> <span class="pre">Response</span></code> frame.</li>
</ol>
<p>A node engages this protocol whenever it joins the network, as well as
when it becomes unhappy with its current AP. This might happen, for
example, because the signal from its current AP has weakened due to the
node moving away from it. Whenever a node acquires a new AP, the new AP
notifies the old AP of the change (this happens in step&nbsp;4) via the
distribution system.</p>

<p>Consider the situation shown in <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-wireless3"><span class="std std-numref">Figure 49</span></a>,
where node C moves from the cell serviced by AP-1 to the cell serviced
by AP-2. As it moves, it sends <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Probe</span></code> frames, which eventually
result in <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Probe</span> <span class="pre">Response</span></code> frames from AP-2. At some point, C
prefers AP-2 over AP-1, and so it associates itself with that access
point.</p>
<p>The mechanism just described is called <em>active scanning</em> since the
node is actively searching for an access point. APs also periodically
send a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Beacon</span></code> frame that advertises the capabilities of the access
point; these include the transmission rates supported by the AP. This
is called <em>passive scanning</em>, and a node can change to this AP based
on the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Beacon</span></code> frame simply by sending an <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Association</span> <span class="pre">Request</span></code>
frame back to the access point.</p>

<h3>Frame Format<a class="headerlink" href="#frame-format" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Most of the 802.11 frame format, which is depicted in
<a class="reference internal" href="#fig-802-11-format"><span class="std std-numref">Figure 50</span></a>, is exactly what we would
expect. The frame contains the source and destination node addresses,
each of which is 48 bits long; up to 2312&nbsp;bytes of data; and a 32-bit
CRC. The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Control</span></code> field contains three subfields of interest (not
shown): a 6-bit <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Type</span></code> field that indicates whether the frame
carries data, is an RTS or CTS frame, or is being used by the scanning
algorithm, and a pair of 1-bit fields—called <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ToDS</span></code> and
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">FromDS</span></code>—that are described below.</p>
<div class="figure align-center" id="id9">

<p class="caption"><span class="caption-number">Figure 50. </span><span class="caption-text">802.11 frame format.</span></p>
</div>
<p>The peculiar thing about the 802.11 frame format is that it contains
four, rather than two, addresses. How these addresses are interpreted
depends on the settings of the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ToDS</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">FromDS</span></code> bits in the
frame’s <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Control</span></code> field. This is to account for the possibility that
the frame had to be forwarded across the distribution system, which
would mean that the original sender is not necessarily the same as the
most recent transmitting node. Similar reasoning applies to the
destination address. In the simplest case, when one node is sending
directly to another, both the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">DS</span></code> bits are 0, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Addr1</span></code> identifies
the target node, and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Addr2</span></code> identifies the source node. In the most
complex case, both <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">DS</span></code> bits are set to 1, indicating that the
message went from a wireless node onto the distribution system, and
then from the distribution system to another wireless node. With both
bits set, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Addr1</span></code> identifies the ultimate destination, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Addr2</span></code>
identifies the immediate sender (the one that forwarded the frame from
the distribution system to the ultimate destination), <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Addr3</span></code>
identifies the intermediate destination (the one that accepted the
frame from a wireless node and forwarded it across the distribution
system), and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Addr4</span></code> identifies the original source. In terms of the
example given in <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-wireless2"><span class="std std-numref">Figure 48</span></a>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Addr1</span></code>
corresponds to E, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Addr2</span></code> identifies AP-3, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Addr3</span></code> corresponds to
AP-1, and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Addr4</span></code> identifies
A.</p>

<h3>Security of Wireless Links<a class="headerlink" href="#security-of-wireless-links" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>One of the fairly obvious problems of wireless links compared to wires
or fibers is that you can’t be too sure where your data has gone. You
can probably figure out if it was received by the intended receiver, but
there is no telling how many other receivers might have also picked up
your transmission. So, if you are concerned about the privacy of your
data, wireless networks present a challenge.</p>
<p>Even if you are not concerned about data privacy—or perhaps have taken
care of it in some other way—you may be concerned about an unauthorized
user injecting data into your network. If nothing else, such a user
might be able to consume resources that you would prefer to consume
yourself, such as the finite bandwidth between your house and your ISP.</p>
<p>For these reasons, wireless networks typically come with some sort of
mechanism to control access to both the link itself and the transmitted
data. These mechanisms are often categorized as <em>wireless security.</em> The
widely adopted WPA2 is described in Chapter 8.</p>

<h2>Bluetooth (802.15.1)<a class="headerlink" href="#bluetooth-802-15-1" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Bluetooth fills the niche of very short range communication between
mobile phones, PDAs, notebook computers, and other personal or
peripheral devices. For example, Bluetooth can be used to connect a
mobile phone to a headset or a notebook computer to a keyboard. Roughly
speaking, Bluetooth is a more convenient alternative to connecting two
devices with a wire. In such applications, it is not necessary to
provide much range or bandwidth. This means that Bluetooth radios can
use quite low power transmission, since transmission power is one of the
main factors affecting bandwidth and range of wireless links. This
matches the target applications for Bluetooth-enabled devices—most of
them are battery powered (such as the ubiquitous phone headset) and
hence it is important that they not consume much power.</p>
<p>Bluetooth operates in the license-exempt band at 2.45 GHz. Bluetooth
links have typical bandwidths around 1 to 3 Mbps and a range of about
10&nbsp;m. For this reason, and because the communicating devices typically
belong to one individual or group, Bluetooth is sometimes categorized as
a Personal Area Network (PAN).</p>
<p>Bluetooth is specified by an industry consortium called the <em>Bluetooth
Special Interest Group</em>. It specifies an entire suite of protocols,
going beyond the link layer to define application protocols, which it
calls <em>profiles</em>, for a range of applications. For example, there is a
profile for synchronizing a PDA with a personal computer. Another
profile gives a mobile computer access to a wired LAN in the manner of
802.11, although this was not Bluetooth’s original goal. The IEEE
802.15.1 standard is based on Bluetooth but excludes the application
protocols.</p>
<p>The basic Bluetooth network configuration, called a <em>piconet</em>,
consists of a master device and up to seven slave devices, as shown in
<a class="reference internal" href="#fig-wirelessbluetoothpiconet"><span class="std std-numref">Figure 51</span></a>. Any communication
is between the master and a slave; the slaves do not communicate
directly with each other. Because slaves have a simpler role, their
Bluetooth hardware and software can be simpler and cheaper.</p>
<div class="figure align-center" id="id10">
<span id="fig-wirelessbluetoothpiconet"></span><a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/f02-35-9780123850591.png"><img alt="../_images/f02-35-9780123850591.png" src="../_images/f02-35-9780123850591.png" style="width: 400px;" /></a>
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-number">Figure 51. </span><span class="caption-text">A Bluetooth piconet.</span></p>
</div>
<p>Since Bluetooth operates in an license-exempt band, it is required to
use a spread spectrum technique to deal with possible interference in
the band. It uses frequency-hopping with 79 <em>channels</em> (frequencies),
using each for 625&nbsp;μs at a time. This provides a natural time slot for
Bluetooth to use for
synchronous time division multiplexing. A frame takes up 1, 3, or 5
consecutive time slots. Only the master can start to transmit in
odd-numbered slots. A slave can start to transmit in an even-numbered
slot—but only in response to a request from the master during the
previous slot, thereby preventing any contention between the slave
devices.</p>
<p>A slave device can be <em>parked</em>; that is, it is set to an inactive,
low-power state. A parked device cannot communicate on the piconet; it
can only be reactivated by the master. A piconet can have up to 255
parked devices in addition to its active slave devices.</p>
<p>In the realm of very low-power, short-range communication there are a
few other technologies besides Bluetooth. One of these is ZigBee,
devised by the ZigBee alliance and standardized as IEEE 802.15.4. It is
designed for situations where the bandwidth requirements are low and
power consumption must be very low to give very long battery life. It is
also intended to be simpler and cheaper than Bluetooth, making it
feasible to incorporate in cheaper devices such as <em>sensors</em>. Sensors
are becoming an increasingly important class of networked device, as
technology advances to the point where very cheap small devices can be
deployed in large quantities to monitor things like temperature,
humidity, and energy consumption in a building.</p>
