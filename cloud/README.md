# README

This repo contains a collection of sections (articles) related to
cloud networking: both how Internet protocols have been adapted
to work in data centers and how the cloud has impacted the greater
Internet. This is new material that extends 5E, but it has not yet
been fully integrated into the GitBook defined by the `SUMMARY.md`
file in the main [book](https://github.com/systemsapproach/book) repo.
