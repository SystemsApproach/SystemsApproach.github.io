Preface
=======

It has been nearly ten years since the fifth edition of *Computer
Networks: A Systems Approach* was published. Much has changed in that
time, most notably, the explosion of the cloud and smartphone apps onto
the scene. In many ways, this is reminiscent of the dramatic effect the
Web was having on the Internet when we published the first edition of the
book in 1996.

The sixth edition adapts to the times, but keeps the *Systems Approach*
as its North Star. In broad strokes, we update and improve this new
edition in four main ways:

-  We refresh the examples to reflect the current state of the world.
   This includes deleting anachronisms (e.g., dial-up modem), using
   popular applications (e.g., Netflix, Spotify) to motivate the
   problems being addressed, and updating the numbers to represent the
   state-of-the-art technology (e.g., 10-Gbps Ethernet).

-  We connect the dots between the original research that led to the
   development of technologies like multicast, real-time video
   streaming, and quality-of-service, and the now-familiar cloud
   applications like Zoom, Netflix, and Spotify. This is in
   keeping with our emphasis on the design process and not just the
   end result, which is especially important today since so much of
   the Internet’s functionality is primarily delivered by
   proprietary commercial services. 


- We place the Internet in the broader context of the Cloud, and just
  as importantly, in the context of the commercial forces that are
  shaping the Cloud. This has minimal impact on the technical details
  presented throughout the book, but it is discussed in a new
  *Perspective* section at the end of each chapter. We hope one
  side-effect of this discussion is to foster an appreciation for the
  Internet’s continuous evolution, and the opportunity for innovation
  this represents.
  
- We distil the important principles of network design in a series
  of *Key Takeaways* throughout the book. Each takeaway is a concise
  statement of either a general system design rule or a fundamental
  networking concept, drawing on the examples presented in the
  surrounding text. Pedagogically, these takeaways correspond to the
  high-level *learning objectives* for the book.

New Material in the Sixth Edition
---------------------------------
  
More specifically, the sixth edition includes the following major changes:

-  New Perspective Section in Chapter 1 introduces the recurring
   *Cloudification* theme.
-  New Section 2.8 describes the *Access Network*, including Passive
   Optical Networks (PON) and 5G’s Radio Access Networks (RAN).
-  Refactored topics across Sections 3.1 (*Switching Basics*) and 3.2
   (*Switched Ethernet*), including expanded coverage of VLANs.
-  Section 3.5 updated to include descriptions of *White-Box Switches*
   and *Software-Defined Networks* (SDN).
-  New Perspective Section in Chapter 3 describes virtual network
   ovelays, *VXLAN*, and the
   role of overlays in the Cloud.
-  Refactored topics across Sections 4.1 (*Global Internet*) and 4.2
   (*IP Version 6*).   
-  New Perspective Section in Chapter 4 describes how the *Cloud*
   impacts the Internet’s structure.
-  Section 5.2 expanded to include a discussion of *QUIC*.
-  Section 5.3 expanded to include a description of *gRPC*.
-  Sections 6.3 and 6.4 updated to include descriptions of *TCP CUBIC,
   DCTCP,* and *BBR*.
-  Section 6.4 expanded to include a description of *Active Queue
   Management* (AQM).
-  Section 7.1 expanded to include a description of *Protocol Buffers*.
-  Section 7.2 expanded to include a description of *HTTP Adaptive
   Streaming*.
-  New Section 8.1 introduces the duality of *Threats* and *Trust*.
-  Refactored topics across Sections 8.3 (*Key Predistribution*) and
   8.4 (*Authentication Protocols*).
-  New Perspective Section in Chapter 8 describes *Decentralized
   Identity Management* and the role of *Blockchains*.
-  Section 9.1 updated to include a description of *HTTP/2*, along with
   a discussion of *REST*, *gRPC*, and *Cloud Services*.
-  Section 9.3 expanded to include a description of modern *Network
   Management Systems* including the use of *OpenConfig* and *gNMI*.

Organization
------------

To construct a networking course around the material in this book, it
can be helpful to understand the overall organization, which can be
characterized as having three major parts:

* Conceptual and foundational material, that is, the big ideas at the
  heart of networking.

* Core protocols and algorithms that illustrate how the foundational
  ideas are put to practice.

* Advanced material that might or might not fit in any single semester
  course.

This characterization can be applied at the Chapter level: Chapter 1
is foundational, Chapters 2, 3, 5, and 9 are core, and Chapters 4, 6,
7, and 8 cover more advanced topics.

This characterization can also be applied at the Section level, where
roughly speaking, each Chapter advances from basic concepts to
specific technology to advanced techniques. For example, Chapter 3
starts by introducing the basics of switched networks (3.1), then
covers the specifics of Switched Ethernet and the IP Internet
(3.2-3.4), and concludes with an optional discussion of SDN
(3.5). Similarly, Chapter 6 starts with foundational ideas (6.1-6.2),
then explores TCP congestion control (6.3), and concludes with
optional advanced material (6.4-6.5).
