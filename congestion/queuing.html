<h1>6.2 Queuing Disciplines<a class="headerlink" href="#queuing-disciplines" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Regardless of how simple or how sophisticated the rest of the resource
allocation mechanism is, each router must implement some queuing
discipline that governs how packets are buffered while waiting to be
transmitted. The queuing algorithm can be thought of as allocating both
bandwidth (which packets get transmitted) and buffer space (which
packets get discarded). It also directly affects the latency experienced
by a packet by determining how long a packet waits to be transmitted.
This section introduces two common queuing algorithms—first-in,
first-out (FIFO) and fair queuing (FQ)—and identifies several variations
that have been proposed.</p>
<div class="section" id="fifo">
<h2>FIFO<a class="headerlink" href="#fifo" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The idea of FIFO queuing, also called first-come, first-served (FCFS)
queuing, is simple: The first packet that arrives at a router is the
first packet to be transmitted. This is illustrated in <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-fifo"><span class="std std-numref">Figure
156(a)</span></a>, which shows a FIFO with “slots” to hold up to eight
packets. Given that the amount of buffer space at each router is
finite, if a packet arrives and the queue (buffer space) is full, then
the router discards that packet, as shown in <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-fifo"><span class="std std-numref">Figure 156(b)</span></a>. This is done without regard to which flow the packet
belongs to or how important the packet is. This is sometimes called
<em>tail drop</em>, since packets that arrive at the tail end of the FIFO are
dropped.</p>
<div class="figure align-center" id="id1">
<span id="fig-fifo"></span><a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/f06-05-9780123850591.png"><img alt="../_images/f06-05-9780123850591.png" src="../_images/f06-05-9780123850591.png" style="width: 400px;" /></a>
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-number">Figure 156. </span><span class="caption-text">FIFO queuing (a), and tail drop at a FIFO queue (b).</span></p>
</div>
<p>Note that tail drop and FIFO are two separable ideas. FIFO is a
<em>scheduling discipline</em>—it determines the order in which packets are
transmitted. Tail drop is a <em>drop policy</em>—it determines which packets
get dropped. Because FIFO and tail drop are the simplest instances of
scheduling discipline and drop policy, respectively, they are sometimes
viewed as a bundle—the vanilla queuing implementation. Unfortunately,
the bundle is often referred to simply as <em>FIFO queuing</em>, when it should
more precisely be called <em>FIFO with tail drop</em>. A later section provides
an example of another drop policy, which uses a more complex algorithm
than “Is there a free buffer?” to decide when to drop packets. Such a
drop policy may be used with FIFO, or with more complex scheduling
disciplines.</p>
<p>FIFO with tail drop, as the simplest of all queuing algorithms, is the
most widely used in Internet routers at the time of writing. This simple
approach to queuing pushes all responsibility for congestion control and
resource allocation out to the edges of the network. Thus, the prevalent
form of congestion control in the Internet currently assumes no help
from the routers: TCP takes responsibility for detecting and responding
to congestion. We will see how this works in the next section.</p>
<p>A simple variation on basic FIFO queuing is priority queuing. The idea
is to mark each packet with a priority; the mark could be carried, for
example, in the IP header, as we’ll discuss in a later section. The
routers then implement multiple FIFO queues, one for each priority
class. The router always transmits packets out of the highest-priority
queue if that queue is nonempty before moving on to the next priority
queue. Within each priority, packets are still managed in a FIFO manner.
This idea is a small departure from the best-effort delivery model, but
it does not go so far as to make guarantees to any particular priority
class. It just allows high-priority packets to cut to the front of the
line.</p>
<p>The problem with priority queuing, of course, is that the high-priority
queue can starve out all the other queues; that is, as long as there is
at least one high-priority packet in the high-priority queue,
lower-priority queues do not get served. For this to be viable, there
needs to be hard limits on how much high-priority traffic is inserted in
the queue. It should be immediately clear that we can’t allow users to
set their own packets to high priority in an uncontrolled way; we must
either prevent them from doing this altogether or provide some form of
“pushback” on users. One obvious way to do this is to use economics—the
network could charge more to deliver high-priority packets than
low-priority packets. However, there are significant challenges to
implementing such a scheme in a decentralized environment such as the
Internet.</p>
<p>One situation in which priority queuing is used in the Internet is to
protect the most important packets—typically, the routing updates that
are necessary to stabilize the routing tables after a topology change.
Often there is a special queue for such packets, which can be identified
by the Differentiated Services Code Point (formerly the TOS field) in
the IP header. This is in fact a simple case of the idea of
“Differentiated Services.”</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="fair-queuing">
<h2>Fair Queuing<a class="headerlink" href="#fair-queuing" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The main problem with FIFO queuing is that it does not discriminate
between different traffic sources, or, in the language introduced in the
previous section, it does not separate packets according to the flow to
which they belong. This is a problem at two different levels. At one
level, it is not clear that any congestion-control algorithm implemented
entirely at the source will be able to adequately control congestion
with so little help from the routers. We will suspend judgment on this
point until the next section when we discuss TCP congestion control. At
another level, because the entire congestion-control mechanism is
implemented at the sources and FIFO queuing does not provide a means to
police how well the sources adhere to this mechanism, it is possible for
an ill-behaved source (flow) to capture an arbitrarily large fraction of
the network capacity. Considering the Internet again, it is certainly
possible for a given application not to use TCP and, as a consequence,
to bypass its end-to-end congestion-control mechanism. (Applications
such as Internet telephony do this today.) Such an application is able
to flood the Internet’s routers with its own packets, thereby causing
other applications’ packets to be discarded.</p>
<p>Fair queuing (FQ) is an algorithm that has been designed to address
this problem. The idea of FQ is to maintain a separate queue for each
flow currently being handled by the router. The router then services
these queues in a sort of round-robin, as illustrated in
<a class="reference internal" href="#fig-fq"><span class="std std-numref">Figure 157</span></a>.  When a flow sends packets too quickly,
then its queue fills up. When a queue reaches a particular length,
additional packets belonging to that flow’s queue are discarded. In
this way, a given source cannot arbitrarily increase its share of the
network’s capacity at the expense of other flows.</p>
<div class="figure align-center" id="id2">
<span id="fig-fq"></span><a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/f06-06-9780123850591.png"><img alt="../_images/f06-06-9780123850591.png" src="../_images/f06-06-9780123850591.png" style="width: 350px;" /></a>
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-number">Figure 157. </span><span class="caption-text">Round-robin service of four flows at a router.</span></p>
</div>
<p>Note that FQ does not involve the router telling the traffic sources
anything about the state of the router or in any way limiting how
quickly a given source sends packets. In other words, FQ is still
designed to be used in conjunction with an end-to-end congestion-control
mechanism. It simply segregates traffic so that ill-behaved traffic
sources do not interfere with those that are faithfully implementing the
end-to-end algorithm. FQ also enforces fairness among a collection of
flows managed by a well-behaved congestion-control algorithm.</p>
<p>As simple as the basic idea is, there are still a modest number of
details that you have to get right. The main complication is that the
packets being processed at a router are not necessarily the same length.
To truly allocate the bandwidth of the outgoing link in a fair manner,
it is necessary to take packet length into consideration. For example,
if a router is managing two flows, one with 1000-byte packets and the
other with 500-byte packets (perhaps because of fragmentation upstream
from this router), then a simple round-robin servicing of packets from
each flow’s queue will give the first flow two-thirds of the link’s
bandwidth and the second flow only one-third of its bandwidth.</p>
<p>What we really want is bit-by-bit round-robin, where the router
transmits a bit from flow 1, then a bit from flow 2, and so on. Clearly,
it is not feasible to interleave the bits from different packets. The FQ
mechanism therefore simulates this behavior by first determining when a
given packet would finish being transmitted if it were being sent using
bit-by-bit round-robin and then using this finishing time to sequence
the packets for transmission.</p>
<p>To understand the algorithm for approximating bit-by-bit round-robin,
consider the behavior of a single flow and imagine a clock that ticks
once each time one bit is transmitted from all of the active flows. (A
flow is active when it has data in the queue.) For this flow, let <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(P_i\)</span>
denote the length of packet <em>i</em>, let <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(S_i\)</span> denote the time when the
router starts to transmit packet <em>i</em>, and let <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(F_i\)</span>
denote the time when the router finishes transmitting packet <em>i</em>. If
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(P_i\)</span> is expressed in terms of how many clock ticks it takes to transmit
packet <em>i</em> (keeping in mind that time advances 1 tick each time this
flow gets 1 bit’s worth of service), then it is easy to see that
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(F_i = S_i + P_i\)</span>.</p>
<p>When do we start transmitting packet <em>i</em>? The answer to this question
depends on whether packet <em>i</em> arrived before or after the router
finished transmitting packet <em>i-1</em> from this flow. If it was before,
then logically the first bit of packet <em>i</em> is transmitted immediately
after the last bit of packet <em>i-1</em>. On the other hand, it is possible
that the router finished transmitting packet <em>i-1</em> long before <em>i</em>
arrived, meaning that there was a period of time during which the queue
for this flow was empty, so the round-robin mechanism could not transmit
any packets from this flow. If we let <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A_i\)</span>
denote the time that packet <em>i</em> arrives at the router, then
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(S_i = \max(F_{i-1}, A_i)\)</span>. Thus, we can compute</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[F_i = \max(F_{i-1}, A_i) + P_i\]</div>
<p>Now we move on to the situation in which there is more than one flow,
and we find that there is a catch to determining <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A_i\)</span>.
We can’t just read the wall clock when the packet arrives. As noted
above, we want time to advance by one tick each time all the active
flows get one bit of service under bit-by-bit round-robin, so we need a
clock that advances more slowly when there are more flows. Specifically,
the clock must advance by one tick when <em>n</em> bits are transmitted if
there are <em>n</em> active flows. This clock will be used to calculate
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A_i\)</span>.</p>
<p>Now, for every flow, we calculate <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(F_i\)</span> for each packet that arrives
using the above formula. We then treat all the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(F_i\)</span> as timestamps,
and the next packet to transmit is always the packet
that has the lowest timestamp—the packet that, based on the above
reasoning, should finish transmission before all others.</p>
<p>Note that this means that a packet can arrive on a flow, and, because it
is shorter than a packet from some other flow that is already in the
queue waiting to be transmitted, it can be inserted into the queue in
front of that longer packet. However, this does not mean that a newly
arriving packet can preempt a packet that is currently being
transmitted. It is this lack of preemption that keeps the implementation
of FQ just described from exactly simulating the bit-by-bit round-robin
scheme that we are attempting to approximate.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="caption-number">Figure 158. </span><span class="caption-text">Example of fair queuing in action: (a) Packets with
earlier finishing times are sent first; (b)&nbsp;sending of a packet
already in progress is completed.</span></p>
</div>
<p>To better see how this implementation of fair queuing works, consider
the example given in <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-fair-queuing"><span class="std std-numref">Figure 158</span></a>. Part&nbsp;(a)
shows the queues for two flows; the algorithm selects both packets
from flow&nbsp;1 to be transmitted before the packet in the flow&nbsp;2 queue,
because of their earlier finishing times. In&nbsp;(b), the router has
already begun to send a packet from flow&nbsp;2 when the packet from flow&nbsp;1
arrives. Though the packet arriving on flow&nbsp;1 would have finished
before flow&nbsp;2 if we had been using perfect bit-by-bit fair queuing,
the implementation does not preempt the flow 2 packet.</p>
<p>There are two things to notice about fair queuing. First, the link is
never left idle as long as there is at least one packet in the queue.
Any queuing scheme with this characteristic is said to be <em>work
conserving</em>. One effect of being work conserving is that if I am sharing
a link with a lot of flows that are not sending any data then; I can use
the full link capacity for my flow. As soon as the other flows start
sending, however, they will start to use their share and the capacity
available to my flow will drop.</p>
<p>The second thing to notice is that if the link is fully loaded and there
are <em>n</em> flows sending data, I cannot use more than 1/n<sup>th</sup>
of the link bandwidth. If I try to send more than that, my packets
will be assigned increasingly large timestamps, causing them to sit in
the queue longer awaiting transmission. Eventually, the queue will
overflow—although whether it is my packets or someone else’s that are
dropped is a decision that is not determined by the fact that we are
using fair queuing. This is determined by the drop policy; FQ is a
scheduling algorithm, which, like FIFO, may be combined with various
drop policies.</p>
<p>Because FQ is work conserving, any bandwidth that is not used by one
flow is automatically available to other flows. For example, if we have
four flows passing through a router, and all of them are sending
packets, then each one will receive one-quarter of the bandwidth. But,
if one of them is idle long enough that all its packets drain out of the
router’s queue, then the available bandwidth will be shared among the
remaining three flows, which will each now receive one-third of the
bandwidth. Thus, we can think of FQ as providing a guaranteed minimum
share of bandwidth to each flow, with the possibility that it can get
more than its guarantee if other flows are not using their shares.</p>
<p>It is possible to implement a variation of FQ, called <em>weighted fair
queuing</em> (WFQ), that allows a weight to be assigned to each flow
(queue). This weight logically specifies how many bits to transmit each
time the router services that queue, which effectively controls the
percentage of the link’s bandwidth that flow will get. Simple FQ
gives each queue a weight of 1, which means that logically only 1 bit is
transmitted from each queue each time around. This results in each flow
getting <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(1/n^{th}\)</span> of the bandwidth when there are <em>n</em>
flows. With WFQ, however, one queue might have a weight of 2, a second
queue might have a weight of 1,
and a third queue might have a weight of 3. Assuming that each queue
always contains a packet waiting to be transmitted, the first flow will
get one-third of the available bandwidth, the second will get one-sixth
of the available bandwidth, and the third will get one-half of the
available bandwidth.</p>
<p>While we have described WFQ in terms of flows, note that it could be
implemented on <em>classes</em> of traffic, where classes are defined in some
other way than the simple flows introduced at the start of this chapter.
For example, we could use some bits in the IP header to identify classes
and allocate a queue and a weight to each class. This is exactly what is
proposed as part of the Differentiated Services architecture described
in a later section.</p>
<p>Note that a router performing WFQ must learn what weights to assign to
each queue from somewhere, either by manual configuration or by some
sort of signalling from the sources. In the latter case, we are moving
toward a reservation-based model. Just assigning a weight to a queue
provides a rather weak form of reservation because these weights are
only indirectly related to the bandwidth the flow receives. (The
bandwidth available to a flow also depends, for example, on how many
other flows are sharing the link.) We will see in a later section how
WFQ can be used as a component of a reservation-based resource
allocation mechanism.</p>
<div class="admonition-key-takeaway admonition" id="key-policy-mechanism">
<p class="first admonition-title">Key Takeaway</p>
<p class="last">Finally, we observe that this whole discussion of queue management
illustrates an important system design principle known as
<em>separating policy and mechanism</em>. The idea is to view each
mechanism as a black box that provides a multifaceted service that
can be controlled by a set of knobs. A policy specifies a
particular setting of those knobs but does not know (or care) about
how the black box is implemented.  In this case, the mechanism in
question is the queuing discipline, and the policy is a particular
setting of which flow gets what level of service (e.g., priority or
weight). We discuss some policies that can be used with the WFQ
mechanism in a later section. <a class="reference internal" href="avoidance.html#key-red"><span class="std std-ref">[Next]</span></a></p>
