                                <h1 id="64-congestion-avoidance-mechanisms">6.4 Congestion-Avoidance Mechanisms</h1>
<p>It is important to understand that TCP&apos;s strategy is to control
congestion once it happens, as opposed to trying to avoid congestion in
the first place. In fact, TCP repeatedly increases the load it imposes
on the network in an effort to find the point at which congestion
occurs, and then it backs off from this point. Said another way, TCP
<em>needs</em> to create losses to find the available bandwidth of the
connection. An appealing alternative, but one that has not yet been
widely adopted, is to predict when congestion is about to happen and
then to reduce the rate at which hosts send data just before packets
start being discarded. We call such a strategy <em>congestion avoidance</em>,
to distinguish it from <em>congestion control</em>.</p>
<p>This section describes three different congestion-avoidance mechanisms.
The first two take a similar approach: They put a small amount of
additional functionality into the router to assist the end node in the
anticipation of congestion. The third mechanism is very different from
the first two: It attempts to avoid congestion purely from the end
nodes.</p>
<h2 id="decbit">DECbit</h2>
<p>The first mechanism was developed for use on the Digital Network
Architecture (DNA), a connectionless network with a connection-oriented
transport protocol. This mechanism could, therefore, also be applied to
TCP and IP. As noted above, the idea here is to more evenly split the
responsibility for congestion control between the routers and the end
nodes. Each router monitors the load it is experiencing and explicitly
notifies the end nodes when congestion is about to occur. This
notification is implemented by setting a binary congestion bit in the
packets that flow through the router, hence the name <em>DECbit</em>. The
destination host then copies this congestion bit into the ACK it sends
back to the source. Finally, the source adjusts its sending rate so as
to avoid congestion. The following discussion describes the algorithm in
more detail, starting with what happens in the router.</p>
<p>A single congestion bit is added to the packet header. A router sets
this bit in a packet if its average queue length is greater than or
equal to 1 at the time the packet arrives. This average queue length is
measured over a time interval that spans the last
busy+idle cycle, plus the current busy cycle. (The
router is <em>busy</em> when it is transmitting and <em>idle</em> when it is not.)
<a href="#decbit">Figure 1</a> shows the queue length at a router as a function of
time. Essentially, the router calculates the area under the curve and
divides this value by the time interval to compute the average queue
length. Using a queue length of 1 as the trigger for setting the
congestion bit is a trade-off between significant queuing (and hence
higher throughput) and increased idle time (and hence lower delay). In
other words, a queue length of 1 seems to optimize the power function.</p>

    <figcaption>Computing average queue length at a router.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Now turning our attention to the host half of the mechanism, the source
records how many of its packets resulted in some router setting the
congestion bit. In particular, the source maintains a congestion window,
just as in TCP, and watches to see what fraction of the last window&apos;s
worth of packets resulted in the bit being set. If less than 50% of the
packets had the bit set, then the source increases its congestion window
by one packet. If 50% or more of the last window&apos;s worth of packets had
the congestion bit set, then the source decreases its congestion window
to 0.875 times the previous value. The value 50% was chosen as the
threshold based on analysis that showed it to correspond to the peak of
the power curve. The &quot;increase by 1, decrease by 0.875&quot; rule was
selected because additive increase/multiplicative decrease makes the
mechanism stable.</p>
<h2 id="random-early-detection-red">Random Early Detection (RED)</h2>
<p>A second mechanism, called <em>random early detection</em> (RED), is similar to
the DECbit scheme in that each router is programmed to monitor its own
queue length and, when it detects that congestion is imminent, to notify
the source to adjust its congestion window. RED, invented by Sally Floyd
and Van Jacobson in the early 1990s, differs from the DECbit scheme in
two major ways.</p>
<p>The first is that rather than explicitly sending a congestion
notification message to the source, RED is most commonly implemented
such that it <em>implicitly</em> notifies the source of congestion by dropping
one of its packets. The source is, therefore, effectively notified by
the subsequent timeout or duplicate ACK. In case you haven&apos;t already
guessed, RED is designed to be used in conjunction with TCP, which
currently detects congestion by means of timeouts (or some other means
of detecting packet loss such as duplicate ACKs). As the &quot;early&quot; part of
the RED acronym suggests, the gateway drops the packet earlier than it
would have to, so as to notify the source that it should decrease its
congestion window sooner than it would normally have. In other words,
the router drops a few packets before it has exhausted its buffer space
completely, so as to cause the source to slow down, with the hope that
this will mean it does not have to drop lots of packets later on. Note
that RED could easily be adapted to work with an explicit feedback
scheme simply by <em>marking</em> a packet instead of <em>dropping</em> it, as
discussed in the sidebar on Explicit Congestion Notification.</p>
<p>The second difference between RED and DECbit is in the details of how
RED decides when to drop a packet and what packet it decides to drop. To
understand the basic idea, consider a simple FIFO queue. Rather than
wait for the queue to become completely full and then be forced to drop
each arriving packet (the tail drop policy of the previous section), we
could decide to drop each arriving packet with some <em>drop probability</em>
whenever the queue length exceeds some <em>drop level</em>. This idea is called
<em>early random drop</em>. The RED algorithm defines the details of how to
monitor the queue length and when to drop a packet.</p>
<p>In the following paragraphs, we describe the RED algorithm as originally
proposed by Floyd and Jacobson. We note that several modifications have
since been proposed both by the inventors and by other researchers; some
of these are discussed in Further Reading. However, the key ideas are
the same as those presented below, and most current implementations are
close to the algorithm that follows.</p>
<p>First, RED computes an average queue length using a weighted running
average similar to the one used in the original TCP timeout computation.
That is, <code>AvgLen</code> is computed as</p>
<pre><code class="lang-pseudo">AvgLen = (1 - Weight) x AvgLen + Weight x SampleLen
</code></pre>
<p>where 0 &lt; <code>Weight</code> &lt; 1 and <code>SampleLen</code> is the length of the
queue when a sample measurement is made. In most software
implementations, the queue length is measured every time a new packet
arrives at the gateway. In hardware, it might be calculated at some
fixed sampling interval.</p>
<p>The reason for using an average queue length rather than an
instantaneous one is that it more accurately captures the notion of
congestion. Because of the bursty nature of Internet traffic, queues can
become full very quickly and then become empty again. If a queue is
spending most of its time empty, then it&apos;s probably not appropriate to
conclude that the router is congested and to tell the hosts to slow
down. Thus, the weighted running average calculation tries to detect
long-lived congestion, as indicated in the right-hand portion of
<a href="#red-avg">Figure 2</a>, by filtering out short-term changes in the queue
length. You can think of the running average as a low-pass filter, where
<code>Weight</code> determines the time constant of the filter. The question of
how we pick this time constant is discussed below.</p>
<figure class="line">

    <img src="figures/f06-15-9780123850591.png" width="500px">
    <figcaption>Weighted running average queue length.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Second, RED has two queue length thresholds that trigger certain
activity: <code>MinThreshold</code> and <code>MaxThreshold</code>. When a packet arrives
at the gateway, RED compares the current <code>AvgLen</code> with these two
thresholds, according to the following rules:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-pseudo">if AvgLen &lt;= MinThreshold
    queue the packet
if MinThreshold &lt; AvgLen &lt; MaxThreshold
    calculate probability P
    drop the arriving packet with probability P
if MaxThreshold &lt;= AvgLen
    drop the arriving packet
</code></pre>
<p>If the average queue length is smaller than the lower threshold, no
action is taken, and if the average queue length is larger than the
upper threshold, then the packet is always dropped. If the average queue
length is between the two thresholds, then the newly arriving packet is
dropped with some probability <code>P</code>. This situation is depicted in
<a href="#red">Figure 3</a>. The approximate relationship between <code>P</code> and
<code>AvgLen</code> is shown in <a href="#red-prob">Figure 4</a>. Note that the probability
of drop increases slowly when <code>AvgLen</code> is between the two thresholds,
reaching <code>MaxP</code> at the upper threshold, at which point it jumps to
unity. The rationale behind this is that, if <code>AvgLen</code> reaches the
upper threshold, then the gentle approach (dropping a few packets) is
not working and drastic measures are called for: dropping all arriving
packets. Some research has suggested that a smoother transition from
random dropping to complete dropping, rather than the discontinuous
approach shown here, may be appropriate.</p>

    <figcaption>Drop probability function for RED.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Although <a href="#red-prob">Figure 4</a> shows the probability of drop as a
function only of <code>AvgLen</code>, the situation is actually a little more
complicated. In fact, <code>P</code> is a function of both <code>AvgLen</code> and how
long it has been since the last packet was dropped. Specifically, it is
computed as follows:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-pseudo">TempP = MaxP x (AvgLen - MinThreshold) / (MaxThreshold - MinThreshold)
P = TempP/(1 - count x TempP)
</code></pre>
<p><code>TempP</code> is the variable that is plotted on the y-axis in
<a href="#red-prob">Figure 4</a>, <code>count</code> keeps track of how many newly arriving
packets have been queued (not dropped), and <code>AvgLen</code> has been between
the two thresholds. <code>P</code> increases slowly as <code>count</code> increases,
thereby making a drop increasingly likely as the time since the last
drop increases. This makes closely spaced drops relatively less likely
than widely spaced drops. This extra step in calculating <code>P</code> was
introduced by the inventorsof RED when they observed that, without it,
the packet drops were not well distributed in time but instead tended to
occur in clusters. Because packet arrivals from a certain connection are
likely to arrive in bursts, this clustering of drops is likely to cause
multiple drops in a single connection. This is not desirable, since only
one drop per round-trip time is enough to cause a connection to reduce
its window size, whereas multiple drops might send it back into slow
start.</p>
<p>As an example, suppose that we set <code>MaxP</code> to 0.02 and <code>count</code> is
initialized to zero. If the average queue length were halfway between
the two thresholds, then <code>TempP</code>, and the initial value of <code>P</code>,
would be half of <code>MaxP</code>, or 0.01. An arriving packet, of course, has a
99 in 100 chance of getting into the queue at this point. With each
successive packet that is not dropped, <code>P</code> slowly increases, and by
the time 50 packets have arrived without a drop, <code>P</code> would have
doubled to 0.02. In the unlikely event that 99 packets arrived without
loss, <code>P</code> reaches 1, guaranteeing that the next packet is dropped. The
important thing about this part of the algorithm is that it ensures a
roughly even distribution of drops over time.</p>
<p>The intent is that, if RED drops a small percentage of packets when
<code>AvgLen</code> exceeds <code>MinThreshold</code>, this will cause a few TCP
connections to reduce their window sizes, which in turn will reduce the
rate at which packets arrive at the router. All going well, <code>AvgLen</code>
will then decrease and congestion is avoided. The queue length can be
kept short, while throughput remains high since few packets are dropped.</p>
<p>Note that, because RED is operating on a queue length averaged over
time, it is possible for the instantaneous queue length to be much
longer than <code>AvgLen</code>. In this case, if a packet arrives and there is
nowhere to put it, then it will have to be dropped. When this happens,
RED is operating in tail drop mode. One of the goals of RED is to
prevent tail drop behavior if possible.</p>
<p>The random nature of RED confers an interesting property on the
algorithm. Because RED drops packets randomly, the probability that RED
decides to drop a particular flow&apos;s packet(s) is roughly proportional to
the share of the bandwidth that that flow is currently getting at that
router. This is because a flow that is sending a relatively large number
of packets is providing more candidates for random dropping. Thus, there
is some sense of fair resource allocation built into RED, although it is
by no means precise.</p>
<p>Note that a fair amount of analysis has gone into setting the various
RED parameters&#x2014;for example, and <code>Weight</code>&#x2014;all in the name of
optimizing the power function (throughput-to-delay ratio). The
performance of these parameters has also been confirmed through
simulation, and the algorithm has been shown not to be overly sensitive
to them. It is important to keep in mind, however, that all of this
analysis and simulation hinges on a particular characterization of the
network workload. The real contribution of RED is a mechanism by which
the router can more accurately manage its queue length. Defining
precisely what constitutes an optimal queue length depends on the
traffic mix and is still a subject of research, with real information
now being gathered from operational deployment of RED in the Internet.</p>
<p>Consider the setting of the two thresholds, <code>MinThreshold</code> and
<code>MaxThreshold</code>. If the traffic is fairly bursty, then <code>MinThreshold</code>
should be sufficiently large to allow the link utilization to be
maintained at an acceptably high level. Also, the difference between the
two thresholds should be larger than the typical increase in the
calculated average queue length in one RTT. Setting <code>MaxThreshold</code> to
twice <code>MinThreshold</code> seems to be a reasonable rule of thumb given the
traffic mix on today&apos;s Internet. In addition, since we expect the
average queue length to hover between the two thresholds during periods
of high load, there should be enough free buffer space <em>above</em>
<code>MaxThreshold</code> to absorb the natural bursts that occur in Internet
traffic without forcing the router to enter tail drop mode.</p>
<p>We noted above that <code>Weight</code> determines the time constant for the
running average low-pass filter, and this gives us a clue as to how we
might pick a suitable value for it. Recall that RED is trying to send
signals to TCP flows by dropping packets during times of congestion.
Suppose that a router drops a packet from some TCP connection and then
immediately forwards some more packets from the same connection. When
those packets arrive at the receiver, it starts sending duplicate ACKs
to the sender. When the sender sees enough duplicate ACKs, it will
reduce its window size. So, from the time the router drops a packet
until the time when the same router starts to see some relief from the
affected connection in terms of a reduced window size, at least one
round-trip time must elapse for that connection. There is probably not
much point in having the router respond to congestion on time scales
much less than the round-trip time of the connections passing through
it. As noted previously, 100 ms is not a bad estimate of average
round-trip times in the Internet. Thus, <code>Weight</code> should be chosen such
that changes in queue length over time scales much less than 100 ms are
filtered out.</p>
<p>Since RED works by sending signals to TCP flows to tell them to slow
down, you might wonder what would happen if those signals are ignored.
This is often called the <em>unresponsive flow</em> problem, and it has been a
matter of some concern for several years. Unresponsive flows use more
than their fair share of network resources and could cause congestive
collapse if there were enough of them, just as in the days before TCP
congestion control. Some of the techniques described in the next section
can help with this problem by isolating certain classes of traffic from
others. There is also the possibility that a variant of RED could drop
more heavily from flows that are unresponsive to the initial hints that
it sends; this continues to be an area of active research.</p>
<h2 id="source-based-congestion-avoidance">Source-Based Congestion Avoidance</h2>
<p>Unlike the two previous congestion-avoidance schemes, which depended on
new mechanisms in the routers, we now describe a strategy for detecting
the incipient stages of congestion&#x2014;before losses occur&#x2014;from the end
hosts. We first give a brief overview of a collection of related
mechanisms that use different information to detect the early stages of
congestion, and then we describe a specific mechanism in some detail.</p>
<p>The general idea of these techniques is to watch for some sign from the
network that some router&apos;s queue is building up and that congestion will
happen soon if nothing is done about it. For example, the source might
notice that as packet queues build up in the network&apos;s routers, there is
a measurable increase in the RTT for each successive packet it sends.
One particular algorithm exploits this observation as follows: The
congestion window normally increases as in TCP, but every two round-trip
delays the algorithm checks to see if the current RTT is greater than
the average of the minimum and maximum RTTs seen so far. If it is, then
the algorithm decreases the congestion window by one-eighth.</p>
<p>A second algorithm does something similar. The decision as to whether or
not to change the current window size is based on changes to both the
RTT and the window size. The window is adjusted once every two
round-trip delays based on the product</p>
<pre><code class="lang-pseudo">(CurrentWindow - OldWindow) x (CurrentRTT - OldRTT)
</code></pre>
<p>If the result is positive, the source decreases the window size by
one-eighth; if the result is negative or 0, the source increases the
window by one maximum packet size. Note that the window changes during
every adjustment; that is, it oscillates around its optimal point.</p>
<p>Another change seen as the network approaches congestion is the
flattening of the sending rate. A third scheme takes advantage of this
fact. Every RTT, it increases the window size by one packet and compares
the throughput achieved to the throughput when the window was one packet
smaller. If the difference is less than one-half the throughput achieved
when only one packet was in transit&#x2014;as was the case at the beginning
of the connection&#x2014;the algorithm decreases the window by one packet.
This scheme calculates the throughput by dividing the number of bytes
outstanding in the network by the RTT.</p>
<p>A fourth mechanism, the one we are going to describe in more detail, is
similar to this last algorithm in that it looks at changes in the
throughput rate or, more specifically, changes in the sending rate.
However, it differs from the third algorithm in the way it calculates
throughput, and instead of looking for a change in the slope of the
throughput it compares the measured throughput rate with an expected
throughput rate. The algorithm, TCP Vegas, is not widely deployed in the
Internet, but the strategy it takes continues to be studied.</p>
<p>The intuition behind the Vegas algorithm can be seen in the trace of
standard TCP given in <a href="#trace3">Figure 5</a>. The top graph shown in
<a href="#trace3">Figure 5</a> traces the connection&apos;s congestion window; it shows
the same information as the traces given earlier in this section. The
middle and bottom graphs depict new information: The middle graph shows
the average sending rate as measured at the source, and the bottom graph
shows the average queue length as measured at the bottleneck router. All
three graphs are synchronized in time. In the period between 4.5 and
6.0 seconds (shaded region), the congestion window increases (top
graph). We expect the observed throughput to also increase, but instead
it stays flat (middle graph). This is because the throughput cannot
increase beyond the available bandwidth. Beyond this point, any increase
in the window size only results in packets taking up buffer space at the
bottleneck router (bottom graph).</p>

</figure>

<p>A useful metaphor that describes the phenomenon illustrated in
<a href="#trace3">Figure 5</a> is driving on ice. The speedometer (congestion
window) may say that you are going 30 miles an hour, but by looking out
the car window and seeing people pass you on foot (measured sending
rate) you know that you are going no more than 5 miles an hour. The
extra energy is being absorbed by the car&apos;s tires (router buffers).</p>
<p>TCP Vegas uses this idea to measure and control the amount of extra data
this connection has in transit, where by &quot;extra data&quot; we mean data that
the source would not have transmitted had it been trying to match
exactly the available bandwidth of the network. The goal of TCP Vegas is
to maintain the &quot;right&quot; amount of extra data in the network. Obviously,
if a source is sending too much extra data, it will cause long delays
and possibly lead to congestion. Less obviously, if a connection is
sending too little extra data, it cannot respond rapidly enough to
transient increases in the available network bandwidth. TCP Vegas&apos;s
congestion-avoidance actions are based on changes in the estimated
amount of extra data in the network, not only on dropped packets. We now
describe the algorithm in detail.</p>
<p>First, define a given flow&apos;s <code>BaseRTT</code> to be the RTT of a packet when
the flow is not congested. In practice, TCP Vegas sets <code>BaseRTT</code> to
the minimum of all measured round-trip times; it is commonly the RTT of
the first packet sent by the connection, before the router queues
increase due to traffic generated by this flow. If we assume that we are
not overflowing the connection, then the expected throughput is given by</p>
<pre><code class="lang-pseudo">ExpectedRate = CongestionWindow / BaseRTT
</code></pre>
<p>where <code>CongestionWindow</code> is the TCP congestion window, which we assume
(for the purpose of this discussion) to be equal to the number of bytes
in transit.</p>
<p>Second, TCP Vegas calculates the current sending rate, <code>ActualRate</code>.
This is done by recording the sending time for a distinguished packet,
recording how many bytes are transmitted between the time that packet is
sent and when its acknowledgment is received, computing the sample RTT
for the distinguished packet when its acknowledgment arrives, and
dividing the number of bytes transmitted by the sample RTT. This
calculation is done once per round-trip time.</p>
<p>Third, TCP Vegas compares <code>ActualRate</code> to <code>ExpectedRate</code> and adjusts
the window accordingly. We let <code>Diff = ExpectedRate -
ActualRate</code>. Note that <code>Diff</code> is positive or 0 by definition, since
<code>ActualRate &gt;ExpectedRate</code> implies that we need to change <code>BaseRTT</code> to
the latest sampled RTT. We also define two thresholds, <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math><semantics><mrow><mi>&#x3B1;</mi><mo>&lt;</mo><mi>&#x3B2;</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\alpha &lt;

<p>Intuitively, we can see that the farther away the actual throughput gets
from the expected throughput, the more congestion there is in the
network, which implies that the sending rate should be reduced.
The <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math><semantics><mrow><mi>&#x3B2;</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\beta</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="strut" style="height:0.69444em;"></span><span class="strut bottom" style="height:0.8888799999999999em;vertical-align:-0.19444em;"></span><span class="base textstyle uncramped"><span class="mord mathit" style="margin-right:0.05278em;">&#x3B2;</span></span></span></span> threshold triggers this decrease.

within the shaded region. Whenever <code>ActualRate</code> falls below the shaded
region (i.e., gets too far from <code>ExpectedRate</code>), TCP Vegas decreases
the congestion window because it fears that too many packets are being
buffered in the network. Likewise, whenever <code>ActualRate</code> goes above
the shaded region (i.e., gets too close to the <code>ExpectedRate</code>), TCP
Vegas increases the congestion window because it fears that it is
underutilizing the network.</p>

However, it is perhaps more accurate to think in terms of how many extra
<em>buffers</em> the connection is occupying in the network. For example, on a
connection with a <code>BaseRTT</code> of 100 ms and a packet size of 1 KB, if
<span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math><semantics><mrow><mi>&#x3B1;</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\alpha</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="strut" style="height:0.43056em;"></span><span class="strut bottom" style="height:0.43056em;vertical-align:0em;"></span><span class="base textstyle uncramped"><span class="mord mathit" style="margin-right:0.0037em;">&#x3B1;</span></span></span></span> = 30 KBps and <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math><semantics><mrow><mi>&#x3B2;</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\beta</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="strut" style="height:0.69444em;"></span><span class="strut bottom" style="height:0.8888799999999999em;vertical-align:-0.19444em;"></span><span class="base textstyle uncramped"><span class="mord mathit" style="margin-right:0.05278em;">&#x3B2;</span></span></span></span> = 60 KBps, then we can think

<p>Finally, you will notice that TCP Vegas decreases the congestion window
linearly, seemingly in conflict with the rule that multiplicative
decrease is needed to ensure stability. The explanation is that TCP
Vegas does use multiplicative decrease when a timeout occurs; the linear
decrease just described is an <em>early</em> decrease in the congestion window
that should happen before congestion occurs and packets start being
dropped.</p>
