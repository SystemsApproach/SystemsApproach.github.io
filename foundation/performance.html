<h1>1.5 Performance<a class="headerlink" href="#performance" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Up to this point, we have focused primarily on the functional aspects of
networks. Like any computer system, however, computer networks are also
expected to perform well. This is because the effectiveness of
computations distributed over the network often depends directly on the
efficiency with which the network delivers the computation’s data. While
the old programming adage “first get it right and then make it fast”
remains true, in networking it is often necessary to “design for
performance.” It is therefore important to understand the various
factors that impact network performance.</p>
<div class="section" id="bandwidth-and-latency">
<h2>Bandwidth and Latency<a class="headerlink" href="#bandwidth-and-latency" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Network performance is measured in two fundamental ways: <em>bandwidth</em>
(also called <em>throughput</em>) and <em>latency</em> (also called <em>delay</em>). The
bandwidth of a network is given by the number of bits that can be
transmitted over the network in a certain period of time. For example, a
network might have a bandwidth of 10 million bits/second (Mbps), meaning
that it is able to deliver 10&nbsp;million bits every second. It is sometimes
useful to think of bandwidth in terms of how long it takes to transmit
each bit of data. On a 10-Mbps network, for example, it takes 0.1
microsecond (μs) to transmit each bit.</p>
<p>Bandwidth and throughput are subtly different terms. First of all,
bandwidth is literally a measure of the width of a frequency band. For
example, legacy voice-grade telephone lines supported a frequency band
ranging from 300 to 3300&nbsp;Hz; it was said to have a bandwidth of 3300 Hz
- 300 Hz = 3000 Hz. If you see the word <em>bandwidth</em> used in a situation
in which it is being measured in hertz, then it probably refers to the
range of signals that can be accommodated.</p>
<p>When we talk about the bandwidth of a communication link, we normally
refer to the number of bits per second that can be transmitted on the
link. This is also sometimes called the <em>data rate.</em> We might say that
the bandwidth of an Ethernet link is 10&nbsp;Mbps. A useful distinction can
also be made, however, between the maximum data rate that is available
on the&nbsp;link and the number of bits per second that we can actually
transmit over the link in practice. We tend to use the word <em>throughput</em>
to refer to the <em>measured performance</em> of a system. Thus, because of
various inefficiencies of implementation, a pair of nodes connected by a
link with a bandwidth of 10&nbsp;Mbps might achieve a throughput of only
2&nbsp;Mbps. This would mean that an application on one host could send data
to the other host at 2&nbsp;Mbps.</p>
<p>Finally, we often talk about the bandwidth <em>requirements</em> of an
application. This is the number of bits per second that it needs to
transmit over the network to perform acceptably. For some applications,
this might be “whatever I can get”; for others, it might be some fixed
number (preferably not more than the available link bandwidth); and for
others, it might be a number that varies with time. We will provide more
on this topic later in this section.</p>
<p>While you can talk about the bandwidth of the network as a whole,
sometimes you want to be more precise, focusing, for example, on the
bandwidth of a single physical link or of a logical process-to-process
channel. At the physical level, bandwidth is constantly improving, with
no end in sight. Intuitively, if you think of a second of time as a
distance you could measure with a ruler and bandwidth as how many bits
fit in that distance, then you can think of each bit as a pulse of some
width. For example, each bit on a 1-Mbps link is 1 μs wide, while each
bit on a 2-Mbps link is 0.5 μs wide, as illustrated in <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-bit-width"><span class="std std-numref">Figure
16</span></a>. The more sophisticated the transmitting and receiving
technology, the narrower each bit can become and, thus, the higher the
bandwidth. For logical process-to-process channels, bandwidth is also
influenced by other factors, including how many times the software that
implements the channel has to handle, and possibly transform, each bit
of data.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="caption-number">Figure 16. </span><span class="caption-text">Bits transmitted at a particular bandwidth can be
regarded as having some width: (a) bits transmitted at 1 Mbps
(each bit is 1 microsecond wide); (b) bits transmitted at 2 Mbps
(each bit is 0.5 microseconds wide).</span></p>
</div>
<p>The second performance metric, latency, corresponds to how long it takes
a message to travel from one end of a network to the other. (As with
bandwidth, we could be focused on the latency of a single link or an
end-to-end channel.) Latency is measured strictly in terms of time. For
example, a transcontinental network might have a latency of
24&nbsp;milliseconds (ms); that is, it takes a message 24&nbsp;ms to travel from
one coast of North America to the other. There are many situations in
which it is more important to know how long it takes to send a message
from one end of a network to the other and back, rather than the one-way
latency. We call this the <em>round-trip time</em> (RTT) of the network.</p>
<p>We often think of latency as having three components. First, there is
the speed-of-light propagation delay. This delay occurs because nothing,
including a bit on a wire, can travel faster than the speed of light. If
you know the distance between two points, you can calculate the
speed-of-light latency, although you have to be careful because light
travels across different media at different speeds: It travels at
3.0 × 10<sup>8</sup> m/s in a vacuum, 2.3 × 10<sup>8</sup> m/s
in a copper cable, and 2.0 × 10<sup>8</sup> m/s in an optical fiber.
Second, there is the amount of time it takes to transmit a unit of data.
This is a function of the network bandwidth and the size of the packet in
which the data is carried. Third, there may be queuing delays inside the
network, since packet switches generally need to store packets for some
time before forwarding them on an outbound link. So, we could define the
total latency as</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">Latency</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">Propagation</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">Transmit</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">Queue</span>
<span class="n">Propagation</span> <span class="o">=</span>  <span class="n">Distance</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">SpeedOfLight</span>
<span class="n">Transmit</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">Size</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">Bandwidth</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>where <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Distance</span></code> is the length of the wire over which the data will
travel, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">SpeedOfLight</span></code> is the effective speed of light over that wire,
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Size</span></code> is the size of the packet, and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Bandwidth</span></code> is the bandwidth
at which the packet is transmitted. Note that if the message contains
only one bit and we are talking about a single link (as opposed to a
whole network), then the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Transmit</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Queue</span></code> terms are not
relevant, and latency corresponds to the propagation delay only.</p>
<p>Bandwidth and latency combine to define the performance characteristics
of a given link or channel. Their relative importance, however, depends
on the application. For some applications, latency dominates bandwidth.
For example, a client that sends a 1-byte message to a server and
receives a 1-byte message in return is latency bound. Assuming that no
serious computation is involved in preparing the response, the
application will perform much differently on a transcontinental channel
with a 100-ms&nbsp;RTT than it will on an across-the-room channel with a
1-ms&nbsp;RTT. Whether the channel is 1&nbsp;Mbps or 100&nbsp;Mbps is relatively
insignificant, however, since the former implies that the time to
transmit a byte (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Transimt</span></code>) is 8 μs and the latter implies
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Transmit</span></code> = 0.08 μs.</p>
<p>In contrast, consider a digital library program that is being asked to
fetch a 25-megabyte (MB) image—the more bandwidth that is available, the
faster it will be able to return the image to the user. Here, the
bandwidth of the channel dominates performance. To see this, suppose
that the channel has a bandwidth of 10&nbsp;Mbps. It will take 20&nbsp;seconds to
transmit the image (25 × 10<sup>6</sup> × 8-bits / (10 × 10<sup>6</sup>
Mbps = 20 seconds), making it relatively unimportant if the image
is on the other side of a 1-ms channel or a 100-ms channel; the difference
between a 20.001-second response time and a 20.1-second response time is
negligible.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="caption-number">Figure 17. </span><span class="caption-text">Perceived latency (response time) versus round-trip
time for various object sizes and link speeds.</span></p>
</div>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="#fig-latency"><span class="std std-numref">Figure 17</span></a> gives you a sense of how latency or
bandwidth can dominate performance in different circumstances. The
graph shows how long it takes to move objects of various sizes
(1&nbsp;byte, 2&nbsp;KB, 1&nbsp;MB) across networks with RTTs ranging from 1 to
100&nbsp;ms and link speeds of either 1.5 or 10&nbsp;Mbps. We use logarithmic
scales to show relative performance. For a 1-byte object (say, a
keystroke), latency remains almost exactly equal to the RTT, so that
you cannot distinguish between a 1.5-Mbps network and a 10-Mbps
network. For a 2-KB object (say, an email message), the link speed
makes quite a difference on a 1-ms RTT network but a negligible
difference on a 100-ms RTT network. And for a 1-MB object (say, a
digital image), the RTT makes no difference—it is the link speed that
dominates performance across the full range of RTT.</p>
<p>Note that throughout this book we use the terms <em>latency</em> and <em>delay</em> in
a generic way to denote how long it takes to perform a particular
function, such as delivering a message or moving an object. When we are
referring to the specific amount of time it takes a signal to propagate
from one end of a link to another, we use the term <em>propagation delay</em>.
Also, we make it clear in the context of the discussion whether we are
referring to the one-way latency or the round-trip time.</p>
<p>As an aside, computers are becoming so fast that when we connect them to
networks, it is sometimes useful to think, at least figuratively, in
terms of <em>instructions per mile</em>. Consider what happens when a computer
that is able to execute 100&nbsp;billion instructions per second sends a
message out on a channel with a 100-ms&nbsp;RTT. (To make the math easier,
assume that the message covers a distance of 5000 miles.) If that
computer sits idle the full 100&nbsp;ms waiting for a reply message, then it
has forfeited the ability to execute 10&nbsp;billion instructions, or 2
million instructions per mile. It had better have been worth going over
the network to justify this waste.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="delay-bandwidth-product">
<h2>Delay × Bandwidth Product<a class="headerlink" href="#delay-bandwidth-product" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>It is also useful to talk about the product of these two metrics, often
called the <em>delay × bandwidth product</em>. Intuitively, if we think of a
channel between a pair of processes as a hollow pipe (see <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-pipe"><span class="std std-numref">Figure
18</span></a>), where the latency corresponds to the length of the pipe
and the bandwidth gives the diameter of the pipe, then the delay ×
bandwidth product gives the volume of the pipe—the maximum number of
bits that could be in transit through the pipe at any given instant.
Said another way, if latency (measured in time) corresponds to the
length of the pipe, then given the width of each bit (also measured in
time) you can calculate how many bits fit in the pipe. For example, a
transcontinental channel with a one-way latency of 50&nbsp;ms and a bandwidth
of 45 Mbps is able to hold</p>
<p class="centered">
<strong>50 × 10<sup>-3</sup> × 45 × 10<sup>6</sup> <em>bits/sec</em> = 2.25
× 10<sup>6</sup> <em>bits</em></strong></p><p>or approximately 280&nbsp;KB of data. In other words, this example channel
(pipe) holds as many bytes as the memory of a personal computer from the
early 1980s could hold.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="caption-number">Figure 18. </span><span class="caption-text">Network as a pipe.</span></p>
</div>
<p>The delay × bandwidth product is important to know when constructing
high-performance networks because it corresponds to how many bits the
sender must transmit before the first bit arrives at the receiver. If
the sender is expecting the receiver to somehow signal that bits are
starting to arrive, and it takes another channel latency for this signal
to propagate back to the sender, then the sender can send up one <em>RTT ×
bandwidth</em> worth of data before hearing from the receiver that all is
well. The bits in the pipe are said to be “in flight,” which means that
if the receiver tells the sender to stop transmitting it might receive
up to one RTT × bandwidth’s worth of data before the sender manages to
respond. In our example above, that amount corresponds to
5.5 × 10<sup>6</sup> bits (671&nbsp;KB) of data. On the other hand, if
the sender does not fill the pipe—i.e., does not send a whole RTT ×
bandwidth product’s worth of data before it stops to wait for a
signal—the sender will not fully utilize the network.</p>
<p>Note that most of the time we are interested in the RTT scenario,
which we simply refer to as the delay × bandwidth product, without
explicitly saying that “delay” is the RTT (i.e., multiply the one-way
delay by two). Usually, whether the “delay” in delay × bandwidth means
one-way latency or RTT is made clear by the context. <a class="reference internal" href="#tab-delay-bw"><span class="std std-numref">Table 1</span></a> shows some examples of RTT × bandwidth products for
some typical network links.</p>

<h2>High-Speed Networks<a class="headerlink" href="#high-speed-networks" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The seeming continual increase in bandwidth causes network designers to
start thinking about what happens in the limit or, stated another way,
what is the impact on network design of having infinite bandwidth
available.</p>
<p>Although high-speed networks bring a dramatic change in the bandwidth
available to applications, in many respects their impact on how we think
about networking comes in what does <em>not</em> change as bandwidth increases:
the speed of light. To quote Scotty from <em>Star Trek,</em> “Ye cannae change
the laws of physics.” In other words, “high speed” does not mean that
latency improves at the same rate as bandwidth; the transcontinental RTT
of a 1-Gbps link is the same 100&nbsp;ms as it is for a 1-Mbps link.</p>
<p>To appreciate the significance of ever-increasing bandwidth in the face
of fixed latency, consider what is required to transmit a 1-MB file over
a 1-Mbps network versus over a 1-Gbps network, both of which have an RTT
of 100&nbsp;ms. In the case of the 1-Mbps network, it takes 80 round-trip
times to transmit the file; during each RTT, 1.25% of the file is sent.
In contrast, the same 1-MB file doesn’t even come close to filling
1&nbsp;RTT’s worth of the 1-Gbps link, which has a delay × bandwidth product
of 12.5&nbsp;MB.</p>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="#fig-bw-lat"><span class="std std-numref">Figure 19</span></a> illustrates the difference between the two
networks. In effect, the 1-MB file looks like a stream of data that
needs to be transmitted across a 1-Mbps network, while it looks like a
single packet on a 1-Gbps network. To help drive this point home,
consider that a 1-MB file is to a 1-Gbps network what a 1-KB <em>packet</em> is

<p>Another way to think about the situation is that more data can be
transmitted during each RTT on a high-speed network, so much so that a
single RTT becomes a significant amount of time. Thus, while you
wouldn’t think twice about the difference between a file transfer taking
101&nbsp;RTTs rather than 100&nbsp;RTTs (a relative difference of only 1%),
suddenly the difference between 1&nbsp;RTT and 2&nbsp;RTTs is significant—a 100%
increase. In other words, latency, rather than throughput, starts to
dominate our thinking about network design.</p>
<p>Perhaps the best way to understand the relationship between throughput
and latency is to return to basics. The effective end-to-end throughput
that can be achieved over a network is given by the simple relationship</p>
<p class="centered">
<strong>Throughput = TransferSize / TransferTime</strong></p><p>where TransferTime includes not only the elements of one-way
identified earlier in this section, but also any additional time spent
requesting or setting up the transfer. Generally, we represent this
relationship as</p>
<p class="centered">
<strong>TransferTime = RTT + 1/Bandwidth x TransferSize</strong></p><p>We use in this calculation to account for a request message being sent
across the network and the data being sent back. For example, consider a
situation where a user wants to fetch a 1-MB file across a 1-Gbps with a
round-trip time of 100&nbsp;ms. This includes both the transmit time for 1&nbsp;MB
(1 / 1 Gbps × 1 MB = 8 ms) and the 100-ms&nbsp;RTT, for a total transfer time
of 108&nbsp;ms. This means that the effective throughput will be</p>
<p class="centered">
<strong>1 MB / 108 ms = 74.1 Mbps</strong></p><p>not 1&nbsp;Gbps. Clearly, transferring a larger amount of data will help
improve the effective throughput, where in the limit an infinitely large
transfer size will cause the effective throughput to approach the
network bandwidth. On the other hand, having to endure more than
1&nbsp;RTT—for example, to retransmit missing packets—will hurt the effective
throughput for any transfer of finite size and will be most noticeable
for small transfers.</p>

<h2>Application Performance Needs<a class="headerlink" href="#application-performance-needs" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The discussion in this section has taken a network-centric view of
performance; that is, we have talked in terms of what a given link or
channel will support. The unstated assumption has been that application
programs have simple needs—they want as much bandwidth as the network
can provide. This is certainly true of the aforementioned digital
library program that is retrieving a 250-MB image; the more bandwidth
that is available, the faster the program will be able to return the
image to the user.</p>
<p>However, some applications are able to state an upper limit on how much
bandwidth they need. Video applications are a prime example. Suppose one
wants to stream a video that is one quarter the size of a standard TV
screen; that is, it has a resolution of 352 by 240 pixels. If each pixel
is represented by 24 bits of information, as would be the case for
24-bit color, then the size of each frame would be (352 × 240 × 24) /
8 = 247.5 KB If the application needs to support a frame rate of
30&nbsp;frames per second, then it might request a throughput rate of 75
Mbps. The ability of the network to provide more bandwidth is of no
interest to such an application because it has only so much data to
transmit in a given period of time.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the situation is not as simple as this example suggests.
Because the difference between any two adjacent frames in a video stream
is often small, it is possible to compress the video by transmitting
only the differences between adjacent frames. Each frame can also be
compressed because not all the detail in a picture is readily perceived
by a human eye. The compressed video does not flow at a constant rate,
but varies with time according to factors such as the amount of action
and detail in the picture and the compression algorithm being used.
Therefore, it is possible to say what the average bandwidth requirement
will be, but the instantaneous rate may be more or less.</p>
<p>The key issue is the time interval over which the average is computed.
Suppose that this example video application can be compressed down to
the point that it needs only 2&nbsp;Mbps, on average. If it transmits 1
megabit in a 1-second interval and 3&nbsp;megabits in the following 1-second
interval, then over the 2-second interval it is transmitting at an
average rate of 2&nbsp;Mbps; however, this will be of little consolation to a
channel that was engineered to support no more than 2 megabits in any
one second. Clearly, just knowing the average bandwidth needs of an
application will not always suffice.</p>
<p>Generally, however, it is possible to put an upper bound on how large a
burst an application like this is likely to transmit. A burst might be
described by some peak rate that is maintained for some period of time.
Alternatively, it could be described as the number of bytes that can be
sent at the peak rate before reverting to the average rate or some lower
rate. If this peak rate is higher than the available channel capacity,
then the excess data will have to be buffered somewhere, to be
transmitted later. Knowing how big of a burst might be sent allows the
network designer to allocate sufficient buffer capacity to hold the
burst.</p>
<p>Analogous to the way an application’s bandwidth needs can be something
other than “all it can get,” an application’s delay requirements may be
more complex than simply “as little delay as possible.” In the case of
delay, it sometimes doesn’t matter so much whether the one-way latency
of the network is 100&nbsp;ms or 500&nbsp;ms as how much the latency varies from
packet to packet. The variation in latency is called <em>jitter</em>.</p>
<p>Consider the situation in which the source sends a packet once every
33&nbsp;ms, as would be the case for a video application transmitting
frames 30 times a second. If the packets arrive at the destination
spaced out exactly 33&nbsp;ms apart, then we can deduce that the delay
experienced by each packet in the network was exactly the same. If the
spacing between when packets arrive at the destination—sometimes
called the <em>inter-packet gap</em>—is variable, however, then the delay
experienced by the sequence of packets must have also been variable,
and the network is said to have introduced jitter into the packet
stream, as shown in <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-jitter"><span class="std std-numref">Figure 20</span></a>. Such variation
is generally not introduced in a single physical link, but it can
happen when packets experience different queuing delays in a multihop
packet-switched network. This queuing delay corresponds to the
component of latency defined earlier in this section, which varies
with time.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="caption-number">Figure 20. </span><span class="caption-text">Network-induced jitter.</span></p>
</div>
<p>To understand the relevance of jitter, suppose that the packets being
transmitted over the network contain video frames, and in order to
display these frames on the screen the receiver needs to receive a new
one every 33&nbsp;ms. If a frame arrives early, then it can simply be saved
by the receiver until it is time to display it. Unfortunately, if a
frame arrives late, then the receiver will not have the frame it needs
in time to update the screen, and the video quality will suffer; it will
not be smooth. Note that it is not necessary to eliminate jitter, only
to know how bad it is. The reason for this is that if the receiver knows
the upper and lower bounds on the latency that a packet can experience,
it can delay the time at which it starts playing back the video (i.e.,
displays the first frame) long enough to ensure that in the future it
will always have a frame to display when it needs it. The receiver
delays the frame, effectively smoothing out the jitter, by storing it in
a buffer.</p>
